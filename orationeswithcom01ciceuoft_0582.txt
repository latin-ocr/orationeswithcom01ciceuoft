Consilium ς’ though as ‘consilium ’ has cer·
tainly the double sense both of the body,
‘qui in consilio sunt,' and of ‘ advice, de-
liberation,' and so forth, ‘recitari consi-
lium’ is not exactly like ‘recitare sena-
tum’ and ‘testamento heres recitatus est.’
Cicero is fond of using words in a double
sense, and I think he gives two meanings
to ‘consilium ς’ for when the names were
read on this occasion, and they certainly
were read, it was not merely the names
which showed the villainy of the act, for
Cicero says nothing directly against the
men, but it was the ‘decretum’ which
shewed what was done; and the word
‘societas,' ‘partnership,' has no meaning
unless it shows what the partnership was.
Cicero adds ‘comitatus,' which indicates
the ‘ men ' who were in this ‘ societas?

There is a further difficulty in the words
‘consilium dedit) Halm takes this to be
like the expression ‘judices dare‚' but 1
know no example of ‘consilium dare' in
this sense. Suetonius has ‘consilia sor-
tiri.³ Ι think that ‘consilium dedit' does
not mean only those ‘ qui in consilio erant‚'
but the whole thing, the names of the
men and what was done by them, in a
word the ‘ decretum.’ In the word ‘ con-
silium ’ the two senses are sometimes mixed
together, for those who form a ‘ consilium ³
(qui in consilio sunt) are said ‘ire in con-
silium‚' where we hardly know how to
separate the ‘ consilium,' ‘the persons,' from
their ‘consilium' or ‘deliberation:' and
the presiding magistrate is said ‘mit-
tere in consilium' the ‘judiees’ who are
already called the ‘consiliu1n,' before the

magistrate sends them ‘in consilium.³ But
we have something else here. Cicero says
‘consilium dedit ut ab his nummos ac-
ciperet,' where ‘consilium' has the plain
sense of ‘ he gave advice to get money.'

This, Ι believe, is the only sense in which
the words ‘consilium dare' can be used,
but it is very easy to give these words the
further meaning of ‘ consilium constituit '
in connexion with the whole matter, though
‘consilium dedit’ simply by itself would
not mean ‘ consilium constituit.'

As to the words ‘ delectum praeclarum-
que consilium,' Orelli remarks that ‘con-
silium ' in this passage cannot mean ‘ con-
silii sententia,’ as appears from the word
‘ delectum? Orelli also remarks that ‘dare
consilium,' for ‘ consilium constituisse,' is a
strange expression 3 and he suggests the
emendation, ‘ isti dedit scil. facultatem, ei
permisit, concessit, ut cet. ς’ a suggestion
which is quite useless.

they could not keep (obtinere) any longer
that which they had bought from a man
who had no title to sell.' A seller is some-
times called ‘auctor,’ as (Dig. 21. 2. 28)
“ sed si ex utriusque persona, et auctoris et
emptoris '' (and Pro Tullio, § 17 ; Pro
Caecina, c. 10). The seller seems to have
been so called with reference to his obliga-
tion to the buyer, in case the buyer
should be evicted from his purchase. If
the seller gave a ‘ fidejussor’ or surety in
