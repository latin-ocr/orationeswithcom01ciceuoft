326 IN O. VERREM

splendore et summa auctoritate praeditus M. Cossutius. Iste
nihilominus judicium [HS Lxxx] dabat. Ille tametsi recupera-
tores de cohorte latronum sibi parari videbat, tamen judicium
accepturum se esse dicebat. Tum iste maxima voce Venereis
imperat ut Xeno audiret, dum res judicetur, hominem ut asser-
vent3 quum judicata sit, ad se ut adducant: et illud simul dixit,
se non putare illum, si propter divitias poenam damnationis con· .
temneret, etiam virgas contemnere. Hac ille vi et hoc metu
adductus tantum decumanis dedit quantum iste imperavit.

XXIII. Polemarchus est Murgentinus, vir bonus atque hones-
tus. Is quum pro jugeribus quinquaginta medimna Dec decumae
imperarentur, quod recusabat domum ad istum in jus eductus est,
et, quum iste etiam cubaret, 111 cubiculum introductus est, quod
nisi mulieri et decumano patebat alii nemini. Ibi quum pugnis et
calcibus concisus esset, qui Dcc medimnis decidere noluisset, mille
promisit. Eubulidas est Grosphus, Centuripinus, homo quum
virtute et nobilitate domi suae, tum etiam pecunia princeps. Huic

judicium [HS LXXX] dabat] The nu-
merals seem to be uncertain. Klotz and
Iordan have ‘HS Ιο00,’ 311(1 Orelli ‘ HS
LXXX millium?

ut Xeno audiret,] The reading of Klotz
from V is ‘ ut Xeno adesset, (111111 res judi-
caretur: hominem adservent: cum judi-
cata sits &c. One would 111110 supposed
that the w‘ords maxima voce would have

bath or the theatre (Graius, i. 20). Ernesti
thought the words ‘in jus’ were impro-
perly added 3 but this is a strange misun-
derstanding. Cicero evidently means to
say that it was a ver)v irregular affair for
the ‘ praetor' to pretend to be ‘ in jure’ in
his bedchamber.

cuhara] This verb is said to mean a
person lying sick ς 311(1 it often has this

prev ented the adoption of this reading;
though itis true that Klotz has diminished
the effect of‘ maxima 'by writing‘ magna?
But‘ magna xoce' is idle and unmeaning,
unless something followed to explain why
the governor spoke loud. He spoke loud
enough to be heard. The ‘ut . . ut ⁹ occa-
sions no difficulty. The first ‘ ut ³ depends
on ‘maxima,’ the second on ‘ imperat?
Iordan has ‘inagna . .

contemnere]
dan.

23. Is quum] ‘ Ei quum' V, Iordan.

medimna DCC] ‘medimnae 1000 V,
atque edidit Maius quod mireris τ’ Zumpt.
But after adopting ‘ resset ³ (c.18),he may
be excused this.

ad istum injus] A Roman‘ praetor’
could not be‘ in jure, 'that 15, in court in
his 01111 house. It seems that, to be‘ in
jur'e, he must be‘ in tribunali.’ It is no
objection to this, that hc could do certain
acts, not judicial, out of court 3 as, for in-
stance, give his sanction to the manumis-
sion of a slave when he was going to the

. audiret.'
‘contemturum' V, Ior-

11118eaning. See Heindorf, Hor. 1 Sat. ix.

“ Trans Tiberim longe cubat is prope Cae-
saris hortos 3''

but there seems no reason why it may not
be used in a general sense, as it certainly is
here. Ovid (Heroid. 20, v. 164) opposes it
to ‘ valet 2' ‘haec cubat, ille valet,⁷ which
passage, as it clearly shows 111131 ( cubat ’
means there, so it might be alleged to show
that ‘cubat' has this particular sense by
virtue of the contrast (valet) rather than
in itself. And the same may be said of the
passage in Horace, 2 Sat. iii. 289:

“Mater ait pueri menses jam quinque
cubantis,

Frigida si puerum quartana reliquem't ;”

for here the context gives the word its
special meaning. The word occurs in Ho-
race, 2 Ep. ii. 68 ; 311(1 Epod. 3, where
it is said of one reclining at a banquet.
