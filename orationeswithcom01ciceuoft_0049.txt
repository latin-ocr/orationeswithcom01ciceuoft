DIVINATIO. 31

quem sit habiturus non video, nisi quem forte ex illo grege morato-
rum qui subscriptionem sibi postularunt, cuicunque vos delationem
Ex quibus alienissimis hominibus ita paratus venis ut
tibi hospes aliquis sit recipiendus. Quibus ego non sum tantum
honorem habiturus ut ad ea quae dixerint certo loco aut singulatim
unicuique respondeam. Sic breviter, quoniam non consulto sed
casu in eorum mentionem incidi, quasi praeteriens satisfaciam uni-
versis. XVI. Tantane vobis inopia videor esse amicorum ut mihi
non ex his quos mecum adduxerim sed de populo subscriptor
addatur? vobis autem tanta inopia reorum est ut mihi causam
praeripere conemini potius quam aliquos a columna Maenia vestri
ordinis reos reperiatis? Custodem, inquit, Tullio me apponite.
Quid mihi quam multis custodibus opus erit, si te semel ad meas
capsas admisero, qui non solum ne quid enunties sed etiam ne quid
auferas custodiendus sis Ρ Sed de isto custode toto sic vobis bre-
vissime respondeb03 non esse hos tales Viros commissuros ut ad
causam tantam a me susceptam, mihi creditam, quisquam sub—

“ obturbatores quosdam sordidosque causi-
dicos signifieat, qui adhibebantur ad moram
faciendam dum meliores advocati recrea-
1·entur.'’ Manutius thinks there is no
reason to alter ‘ oratorum!

alienissimis] Cicero after his fashion is
playing 011 the name of Alienus, and he is
speaking sarcastically when he says ‘pa-
ratus.' The sense of the passage is this:
‘ You come prepared to accept any of
these men, who are perfect strangers to
you, just as if you had to receive some
strange guest into your house? ‘Ex
quihus' does not depend on ‘ paratus!
These words mean no more hcrc than if we
were to say ‘ex 00 numero.9 A man would
choose his ‘sulmcriptores ' among 1115 friends,
but Caecilius must get whom 110 caiujust 115
if he opened his door to receive the tirst
stranger who presented himself.

simqulatim] The MSS. have this form,
and also ‘singillatim' and ‘ sigillatim? ,It
is possible that all three forms were in use,
bnt ¹ singulatim ' has the reconnnendation
of being eonformable to the word ‘sin-
guli,' the root of which is ¹ sim)

16. de populo] That is, one of the
crowd, any body.
