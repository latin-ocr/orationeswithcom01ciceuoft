ou. As to ‘tector-ium? see thep passages
quoted m Foreellini. ‘113’ says Cicero, ‘I
had thought that the eost of whitening co-
lumns had been so great, Ι should certainiy
never have been a candidate for the aedae-
ship! Cicero (Aet- ii. Lib. 5. e. 14) enu-
mentes, among other duties of the aedile,
‘sacrarum aedium procurationem.³ The
treasury (zetarium) supplied the ‘'aedsses
some money for the costs of their
office, but not enough.

In place of dejectum} the common
reading, which Zumpt and Iol-dan retain,
P. Manutius put ‘delitum‚' which Orelli
has, and Klotz. Vhae DE.ECTV1‚ “litera

have‘ delectam: ‘ldeietum ‘'Deletus and

‘dejectus' are osten confounded' m the MSS.

The Romans put stucco (tectorium) on
brieks and sometimes on stone also.

Atque] The reading of an the MSS„

56. Qu nmmnn] Another clause
inthe termsofthektting wae: “let the
contractor give security for ‘damnum in-
fectum’ tothim who shall have thebuffling
delivered up to him from the former con-
tractor? ‘ Damnum infectum ' is damage
(damnum) not done toaman’s property,

but damage which there· 13 good reason to
expect, if preeautions are not taken (Dig.
39. tit. 2). For instance, if one man's
building threatened damage to another

perty might be required to repeir it, or to
give security (cautio) for any damage that
might be caused by the state of the build-
ing. In this, says Asconius, the new con-
tractor was required to give security to the
former contractor, if he caused any damage
tothebuilding, ‘pro necessitate operis, ² that
is, whiledQQEtheneeaem-yrepairs. Cicero
saysthattheeffectofthisdausewae, that
Rabonius had to give security to himself,
for‘ qui redemerit' is Rabonius, and‘ ei
qui' is Rabonius also, as Manutius shows.
Cicero adds, ‘he is merely moeking us,
when he requires Rabonius togivesecurity
to himself? There is nothing wrong in
the formula itself. The vetus redem p’tur
was the original redemptor Junim, Pwho
was now represented by his son. Rabonim
then took the eontracta (0. 50, and note),
but Verres, not being satisfied with the
state in which Jtmius lest the building,
intended to make 3 new contram for doing
whathepretendedththuniushadlest
trudone, and he declares that the third
contractor shall give security to theseoond
that he wissnotdamage anythingthnt
the second had done. But he intended
that Rabonius should be the third otm-
tractor, and so he would have to give se-
curity to himself. Manutim understood it.
mensumn] ‘ accepit ’ V A, Klotz, Ior-
dam—‘praosens solvetur ἐ an the MSS. have
‘solvitur ’ (Zumpt) ; which he takes to be
equivalent to ‘selmum' which is in fact
the radmg of V. Orelli has ‘ solvatur?
