REPETUNDAE. 47

expressed it, “ad quos ea pecunia pervenit ” (Cic. Ad Div. viii. 8).
Zumpt reconciles the statement of Cicero (Divin. c. 5), that Sicily
claimed ‘ sestertium millies ’ from Verres, with the statement in another
passage that Verres had illegally robbed the Sicilians of ‘ quadringenties
sestertium,’ by assuming that the Lex Cornelia made the damages two
and a half the amount of what had been illegally taken. I am not
aware that there is any other foundation for this assumption than the
fact that Cicero will thus be made consistent. But that is not a satis-
factory way of settling differences. (See the note on Divin. c. 5.) The
amount stated in the Divinatio may have been exaggerated, or there may
have been reasons for claiming less than the amount mentioned in a
speech which was no part of the judicia] proceedingS. The Lex em-
powered the Praetor to allow a second Actio, if the J udices could not
come to a decision on the first hearing3 and the Judices were not to be.
chosen by the prosecutor and the accused, but were determined by lot.
The J udices were taken from the Senators. An alteration was also
made as to the challenge of the J udices, as we may collect from Cicero
(Verr. Act. i. c. 7).

The Lex J ulia de Repetundis was enacted in the first consulship of C.
Julius Caesar Rc. 593 and consequently after the trial of Verres.

The provisions of some of these Leges, the Cornelia for instance,
appear to be very doubtful, and the conclusions of writers, from scattered
passages, are uncertain. (Rein, Das Criminalrecht der Romer, p. 604,
