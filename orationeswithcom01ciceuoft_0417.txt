besides Rome (Sueton. Claud. c. 1). Ho-
race (l Sat. v. 34) met with one at Fundi,
a sels-sufficient fool. These guilds of ‘ scri-
bae' obtained great privileges at Rome,
and subsequently at Constantinople.

The principal passages in the Roman
writers about ‘scribae,' are this chapter;
Cicero Ad Q. Fr. ii. 23 Tacit. Ann. xii. 273
Suetonius, Auyust. 57 ; Claudius, 1. Among
modern writers, Niebuhr, Roman History,
iii. 298, ἃς. English translation 3 Savigny,
System, &c., ii. 253, δῖα, and Becker,
Handbuch, &c. ii. 2, p. 372, may be con-
sulted.

This class of men, who now aspired to
the rank of an ‘ ordo' in the state, took an
active part in politica] mattch, andin times
of political excitement appeared in the pub-
lic places with the clubs (sodalitates), and
threatened the peace of Rome. Cicero
mentions an occasion on which the Senate
made a Consultum‚ which required these
turbulent fellows (sodalitates decuriatique)
to disperse, under pain of coming under the
laws De Vi. The ‘scribae’ belonged to
the class of ‘libertini ;' they were all
‘ libertini,’ as Niebuhr affirms, that is, not
the sons of free-born Romans. It appears
that admission into these ‘ decuriae,’0r some
of them, was purchased. Admission was
also obtained in other WayS, ης, for instance,
by the nomination ofa ‘mag-istratus) There
is a note on the Decuriae and the Scribae
by the learned Henri dc valois, in which
note hc informs us, that Salmasius (Claude
dc Saumaise) stole the substance ofit. (Am-
mianus Marcellinus, Lib. xxviii. c. 6, ed.
J. Gronov.) Horace (Life in the editions
of Suetonius) is said to have got, perhaps
bought (seriptum quaestorium comparavit)
at Rome, a ‘writer's' place in the office
of the ‘ quacstor.' The writings of Horace
show more familiarity with many legal
and tcehnical tei-ms than one would ex-
pect from a poet and an indolent man;
and he may have pickcd up some of this
learning when he was iu the ‘quaestor's'
office.

It would be instructive to trau-e the his-
tory of guilds and companies, which have
made so large a. figure. in modern towns, to
their Roman origiuals3 sor they are un-

doubtedly of Roman origin. The ancient
guilds at Rome were nine in number, as
Niebuhr remarks3 but there were more
than the ancient nine of Numa’s institution
(Plutarch, Numa, c. 17). Niebuhr men-
tions bankers, merchants, watermen of the
river, and butchers. (Comp. these orations,
Lib. ii. c. 55, ‘Nam aut publice,' ἃς.)
But it is probable that all the trades had
their guilds in the later period& both at
Rome and in other towns of Italy. The
‘fullones‚’ for instance, were a numerous
guild at Rome. There is a remark ofNiebuhr
which contains the germ for large inquiries,
and which will be appreciated by those who
know that Roman history is more than the
history of battles and of conquest: “if,
according to the view of a clear-sighted
jurist, which seems to me to carry comic-
tion with it as soon as it is uttered, the
notaries preserved the Roman law in Italy,
the manes of the heroes and lawgivers of
Rome owe it for the most part to a guild,
in which they saw, not uuiustly, a germ
which might produce the destruction of the
old noble institutions—and the pretensions
of which rendered them indignant—that a
late posterity is enabled to know and ad-
mire these iiistitutions, and their develop-
ment.'’

The English name ‘scrivener’ reminds
us of the Roman name ‘scriba ;’ und his
practice, so far as 1 can make it out, bore
some resemblance to the private business of
a ‘scriba.' The racc is said to have. ex-
pired in the person of Juck Ellis, who is
mentioned in Boswell's Life of Johnson,
iii. 20. (Tomlins, Law Dict.)
