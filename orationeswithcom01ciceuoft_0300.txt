282 IN O. VERREM

fenori dabat. Ea autem feneratio crat ejusmodi, judices, ut etiam

is quaestus huic cederet. Nam quas pecunias ferebat iis expensas
quibuscum contrahebat, eas aut scribae istius aut Timarchidi aut

etiam isti ipsi referebat acceptas. Idem praeterea pecunias istius
extraordinarias grandes suo nomine fenerabatur. Hic primo Car-
pinatius, antequam in istius tantam familiaritatem pervenisset,
aliquoties ad socios literas de istius injuriis miserat. Canuleius
Vero, qui in portu Syracusis operas dabat, furta quoque istius “
permulta nominatim ad socios perscripserat, ea quae sine portorio
Syracusis erant exportata: portum autem et scripturam eadem

societas habebat.

‘ capita ' or capital which Carpinatius em-
ployed in money-lending. Such a play on
words is quite in Cicero's fashion.

Nam quas effa] “ For the sums which
he entered in his books against those with
whom 110 contracted, those very sums he
also entered as received either from a
‘ scriba’ of Verres, or from Timarchides,
or from Verres himself.” See Lib. 1. c.
36. Verres, with the aid of this knave,
lent money on interest to those who bor-
rowed it to bribe Verres. This ingenious
way of charging a man with an annual
payment of interest in respect of money of
which 110 never had the use, is a device
that none but a Roman could have hit on.

eoetraordinarias] Such sums as were
not entered in the books of accounts. See
Lib. 1. c. 39.

portorio] The ‘pro magistro ³ informed
his associates that Verres did not pay the
duties on articles exported (portorium) ;
for, adds Cicero, the same ‘ societas ⁵ or com-
pany farmed the ⁶ portoria ' and the ‘ scrip-
tura? Cicero (De Imperio Cn. Pompeii,
c. 6) enumerates the three kinds of (11105
01· payments to the state : “Quum hostium
copiae non longe absunt, etiam si irruptio
facta nulla sit, tamen pecua relinquuntur,
agricultura deseritur, mercatorum naviga-
tio conquiescit : ita neque ex portu, neque
ex decumis, neque ex scriptura vectigal
conservari potest.” The ‘portoria' were
levied at ferries, bridges, and certain bar-
riers, as well as 111 the ports. Probably
they were always levied 011 goods which
passed from one province to another, and
they were also claimed sometimes on goods
carried from one part of the same province
to another, as we see from Cicero (Ad Att.
ii. 16; Dion Cass. xxxvi. 51). This op-
pressive tax was abolished in Italy B.(¹. 60
(Cic. Ad Q. Frat. i. 1. c. 11); but it was
continued in the provinces, and let to the

Publicani, and so the Roman Aerarium
had the benefit of it. Towns which were
‘liberae et immunes' took the ‘ portoria '
for their own use ς at least we know that
many such towns did. The duties levied
in sea—ports seem to us reasonable, because
we are accustomed to them ; but they
were also levied at other placeS‚ as 1 have
observed. The ‘portitores’ or ‘collectors'
lay in wait for the unfortunate merchant
and his goods, and eased him of some of his
money before they would let him pass. A
twentieth of the value, it appears, was pay-
able at Syracuse (c. 75). In France, before
the revolution of ⁹89, the same system of or-
ganized plunder existed. On the banks of
the Loire, for instance, there was a series
of toll-houses, from which the collectors
pounced upon the traveller, and took money
from him under the name of ‘droits de
traite ' for the use of the state, and ‘peages’
in the name of communities or some lord
(L. Blanc, Hist. de la Revol. Francaise,
i. 513). A collector was ‘ portitor.' The
‘portitor Orci ³ (Virg. Georg. iv. 502) was a
personage with whom a Roman was very
familiar in his lifetime.

societas] This is the Roman word for a
partnership, the fundamental rules of which
are the same in the Roman and in the Eng-
lish law. It was one of those ‘ obligationes’
which were formed ‘ consensu ³ (Gaius, iii.
135). Gaius says (iii. 148), “ societatem
coire solemus aut totorum bonorum aut
unius alicujus negotii, veluti mancipiorum
emendorum ant vendendorum.” Some of
the Roman ‘ societates ³ were considered as
artificial persons, a term not unknovm in
the English law, and 'a better term than
‘ corporations.’ Savigny observes, “Also
commercia] undertakings, 111 which indivi-
duals are united, appear 111 the form of
juristical (artificial) persons, and the general
name of such associations is ‘societas ς’ but
