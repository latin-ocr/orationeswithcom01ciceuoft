Apelles, like most great painters, was a
master in porti-ait. (Plin. H. N. xxxv. 10.
Strabo, xiv. p. 657.) The fiugers seemed
to project, and the lightning to stand out
of the picture. The Ceraunophorus was a
great painting, but the criticism of the
sculptor Lysippus was just. Lysippus
blamed Apelles for putting lightning in
the king's hand. The bronze statue of
Alexander by Lysippus held a spear.
Cy:ieenos‚] The dictator Caesar is said
to have bought two pictures by Timoma-
chus, a Medea and an Ajax, for eighty
taleuts (Plin. vii. 38), for the purpose of
placing them in the temple of Venus Ge-
netrix. Zumpt makes a difficulty about
what Pliny says in another place (xxxv.
11), that Timomachus painted these pic-
tures in the time (aetate) of Caesar. But
there seem no grounds for fixing the birth
of Timomachus with any accuracy; and
we know that his period came at least
near enough to the time of Caesar to allow
Pliny to use this expression. Caesar did
not buy the pictures from Timomachus,
for Cicero here speaks of them (B.c. 70)
being in possession of the Cyziceni.
Ialysum ?] The Ialysus and Paralus
were the work of Protogenes. The Ialysus
was taken to Rome and placed in the tem-

of Myro (c. 3), one of the great works of
the class of mere imitative art, was, as it
here appearS, at Athens, Ausonius (58—
68) has eleven epigrams on it, and there
are others in the Anthology. Propertius
(ii. 31, 7) mentions four ‘Myronis . .
boves.'

Zumpt observes that all the passages of
Cicero at least cited by Garatoni here
and in his notes on Lib. 3. c. 1, and on
Agr. ii. 16, and those which Duker de-
fends (Florus, ii. 2. 20), where modo is
omitted when sed etiamz follows, are not
