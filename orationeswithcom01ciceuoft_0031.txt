within the Roman dominions, marked by a
distinet politieal name, and these were
Cives and Peregrini, for the term Peregrini
comprised Latini, Socii, and Provinciales.
After the Social VVar the Civitas was ex-
tended to all Italy, and even comprehended
Gallia Cispadana, which, as is known, was
not at that time included in the term Italia.
Finally, even Gallia Transpadana obtained
the Civitas in Cicero’s lifetime. The class
of Latini and 80011, as above defined, had
now disappeared: they were Cives Romani.
But a new class of Latini was formed—a
class which, except in name, had no rela-
tionship to the former Latini : they had the
Connnercium, but not the Connnbium.
Henceforward we find three political classes
in the Roman state—Cives, who had the
Commereium and Comiubium ; Latini, who
had only the Commereium, and Peregrini,
who had neither. The Sicilians were Pere-
grini after the Soeial War, and at the time
when Cicero was delivering· this oration.
When Cicero calls the Sieilians Socii, he
uses the word just in the same sense as he
does when he speaks of the Socii of the
province of Asia (Ad Q. Fr. i. 1. 0. 1) ; but
not in 1110 same sense in which he uses the
word in another place (De Am. 0. 3), when
he is speaking of the Populus Romanus,
Socii et Latini, of the time. of Scipio Afri-
canus the younger. He says that 1110 111-
habit-ants of Asia, of that province, 00115151
of 80011, that is native-⁴, and Cives, who
were either Publicani or Negotiator-es re-
siding in the province. He calls the Ro-
mans resident in Asia, in one passage, Pro-
vinciales (Ad Q. Fr. i. 1. c. 5), bnt he only
means men who are residing in a province,
and not in Italy. The 101111 Socii may
have 110011 applied to Peregrini out of Italy
before the 8001111 War3 but, if that was the
ease, 1110 Socii of Italy must have been dis-
tinguished from other 80011 by the term
Italici, which term, indeed, designatos Ita-
111111 80011, without 1110 addition of the word
Socii. Cicero 11010 speaks of Socii in the
provinces 115 opposed to stipendiarii, and 110
probably means those who had a⁴ ‘ foedus ’ or
treaty with Rome. The stipendiarii were
those who were. designated simply hy a,
term which expressed their liubility to make

certain fixed payments, 111-1111131111· imposed,
without any ‘foedus ³ or ternis of compaet.
The Socii might either be subject to fixed
payments, or might be free from them 3 but
the circumstance of their having a ‘ foedus'
with Rome distinguished them from those
who had not, and gave them a higher rank.
This subject is discussed by Savigny, Ver—

aeque—atque] This form is common;
it signifies ‘so much as' (0. 12). The
position of ‘nihil' shows how it is to be
understood: ‘Nothing that you can name
and that former energy and dignity of the
judicia are called for in an equal degree?
Cicero (Brutus, 71) says, “qui tibi sunt
aeque noti ae 1111111.” Compare Act. ii.
Lib. 3. 0. 19, “ aequam partem tibi ae
Populo Romano.”

tribunicia poteslas] L. Cornelius Sulla,
during his dictatorship (B.C. 82 ᾉν79), among
other constitutional changes, got a law
passed which deprived the Tribuni plebis of
the power of proposing a Lex in the Comitia.
Tributa, and left 1110111 only their ‘jus in-
tex-cessionis? They were deprived of that
power which the Romans expres-sed hy the
words ‘ agere 011111 populo,’ that is, the
power of holding lneetings and addressing
the people either on the 10111101· ot' u pro-
posed Lex 01· 011 nn)v public business. The
voice of 1110 tribunes was freedoin 0151100011,
which a 111-11111 fcared then as he now nun-s

of the tribunitiam power was tlw destruction
of Roman liberty. Sulln’s law was rc-
pealed (13.C. 70) in the consulship ot* Cn.
Pompeius Magnus und M. Licinius crassus,
a mensure which Cicero, in another place,
says that he could not connnend (De lieg.
iii. 9). The ‘ inconnnoda,¹ just before 111011-
