‘ Ut arator decumano quo vellet decumanus vadimonium promit—
teret 3' ut hic quoque Apronio, quum ex Leontino usque [ad] Lily-

‘promittunt Herbitenses vadimonium Sy*
racusas.’ Shortly after, in this chapter,
we have ‘ [ad] Lilybaeum aliquem vadare-
tur.' Iordan says ⁶ usque ad' Lg. 42.

‘Vadimonium' is thus explained by a
German writer (Puchta, Inst. 11. ξ 160, lst
ed.): “then the parties appeared ‘injure ’
(that is, before the Praetor or other magis-
trate who had ‘jurisdictio ’), as a general
rule, the proeeedings before the ‘magis-
tratus' were by no means ended on the
same day, for the plaintiff now declared to
the defendant what kind of action he in-
tended to bring (Editio Actionis, Dig. 2.
tit. 13), and it was necessary that time
should be allowed to the defendant to pre-
pare his defenee. Accordingly the parties
agreed on a time when they should again
appear ‘injure,' and this engagement is
called ‘ vadimonium,5 and is eomprehended
under the general expression, ‘ cautio jucli-
σέο sisti :³ it refers to a sum of money, as
the ‘poena desertionis,' which, in some
cases, was equal in amount to the matter
in dispute 3 in other easeS, to one-half; but
never exeeeded one hundred thousand ses-
temes. The defendant had, as a general
rule, to furnish sureties (vades) for the
amount of the ‘vadimonium 3' sometimes
the sureties were dispensed with (vadimo-
nium purum) ; in other cases, sureties were
replaced by the oath, or by an immediate
condemnatiou in the amount ofthe ‘ poena,'
by ‘recupe1·at07·es‚’ if the ‘vadimonium’
was broken (Gaius, iv. 184—187). Under
these circumstances, it was manifestly more
convenient for the parties to save them-
selves the first appearance before the court,
and, instead of the ‘ ἱιι jus voc-alio,³ to agree
from the first about a day for the actual
decision of the question, and to secure it
by ‘ vadimonium? This was, in fact, even
in Cicero's time, the usual process; the
proper ‘injus vocatio ' was only used 111 the
case of a stubborn and resisting defendant-'¹
He refers to the passage in Horace (1 Sat.
ix. 74), “casu venit obvius illi Adversa-
rius . . Rapit 111 jus.”

This passage, and another 111 the same
Satire (36),

“ et casu tum respondere vadato
Debebat, quod ni fecisset, perdere litem‚’'

 

may be properly exmnined 11010. 011 the
‘rapit 111 jus,’ Orelli remarks, “ ad reeupe-
ratores vel ad centumvirale judicium ;'' and

then he adds a reference to Plautus, Poen.
iii. 5. 45, “priusquam obtorto collo ad
praetorem trahas 3³³ so that in the same
note he contradicts himself. For ‘ in jus'
15 ‘ before the Praetor or Magistratus,' as
Heindorf rightly explains it, and he quoteS,
to prove what he says, the same passage of
Plautus, which Orelli quotes, without per-
eeiving that it contradicts his own explana-
tion. The scholiast on Horace, Porphyrio,
understands the passage to mean, that as
the man did not appear according to his
‘vadimoniun1,' the ‘adversarius’ arrested
him to drag him before the Praetor, and
he quotes the words of the Twelve Tables,
“ Si in jus vocat, ni it, antestator. Igitur
em capito ;'' but here again there is con-
tradiction, for the ‘in jus vocatio' is the
first step in a suit. As to the correction of
the corrupted text of Porphyrio, see Dirk—
sen, Uebersicht, &e. der Zwolf-Tafel-Frag-
mente, p. 129. According to the explana-
tion of Orelli, the ‘ adversarius' in Horace
is the ‘vadato’ mentioned in v. 36. Ae-
cording to Puchta and others, it cannot be
this ‘ vadat0,' because the ‘ in jus vocatio ’
was the first step in a civil procedure.
Bethman-Hollweg (Handbuch des Civil-
prozesses, i. p. 247, Bonn, 1834), after ex-
plaining the ‘vadimonium ' 111 the same way
as Puchta, adds: “of this ‘vadimonium '
we accordingly find numerous examples in
Cicer0; of the ‘in jus vocatio' not one:
though in the case of such people as the
importunate fellow in Horace, or more ob-
stinate perSO11S,it still did good 501·1’100.“’
Ηο adds, in a note, “ force was used to the
importunate fellow in Horace, in conse-
quence of the ‘ vadimonium ;' for, if a inan
did not keep the ‘ vaulinwnium,' he had still
to apprehend the use of force.’' Ι do not
believe that this explanation is correct ; but
it would bc out of place to follow up this
matter further.

When Hollwcg says that 110 example os
the ‘in jus voeatio' occurs in Cicero, per-
haps he means no example of the violent
process mentioned by Horat-03 for the
phrase occurs often. In De Leg. ii. 4, ‘ A
parviS, Quirites, didicimus, Si injus vocat,'
110-ς Verr. Lib. 2. 0. 76, ‘injus ad Me-
tellum Carpinatium voco;' Lih. 3. c. 47,
‘ 111 jus ipsum eduxi.’ A readcr would
certainly be inclined to conclude that the
‘ adversm-ius: ‘ qui rapit in jus,' in Horace.
is the ‘ vadato ;' and it may be so. But is
it is so, we must conclude that Horace is
