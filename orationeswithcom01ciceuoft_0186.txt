168 IN O. VERREM

venit quin is unoquoque gradu do avaritia tua commoneretur?
quam tu viam thensarum atque pompae ejusmodi exegisti ut tu
ipse illa ire non audeas. Te putet quisquam, quum ab Italia freto
disjunctus esses, sociis temperasse, qui aedem Castoris testem
furtorum tuorum esse volueris, quam populus Romanus quotidie,
judices etiam tum quum de te sententiam ferrent viderent Ρ

LX. Atque etiam judicium in praetura publicum exercuit3 nonv
enim praetereundum est ne id quidem. Petita multa est apud
istum praetorem a Q. Opimio, qui adductus est in judicium, verbo
quod, quum esset tribunus plebis, intercessisset contra legem Cor-
neliam, re vera quod in tribunatu dixisset contra alicujus hominis
nobilis voluntatem. De quo judicio si velim dicere omnia, multi
appellandi laedendique sint, id quod mihi non est necesse. Tantum
dicam, paucos homines, ut levissime dicam, arrogantes hoc adjutore
Q. Opimium per ludum et jocum fortunis omnibus evertisse. Is
mihi etiam queritur quod a nobis 1x solis diebus prima actio sui

it (De Legg. iii. 9), but left them the power

thensarwn] ‘ Thensae ' or ‘tensae ' are
‘ auxilii ferendi? that is, the ‘ intercessio‚’

the sacred vehicles used in the solemn pomp

or procession of the Ludi Circenses, to carry
certain deities in. There is a passage in
the speech of Cicero Pro Cn. Plancio, c. 312
(referred to by Klotz), which seems to show
that Laterensis, one of the accusers of Cn.
Plancius, had referred to this passage and
those quoted in the preceding note, to ridi-
cule Cicero, who defended Plancius.

sociis temperasse,] ¹ refrained from in-
juring,' as the context of course implies.
In ‘ sibi temperare ³ we have also a dative,
but the sense is not the same. Comp. Lib.
2. c. 6, ‘ si cuiquam,’ ἃς.

ferrent viderent ?] ‘ ferent, videbunt '
Iordan. Graevius conjectured ‘ ferent.³
Prisc. and the codd. have ‘ ferrent.' ‘ Vide-
bunt' is the reading of Lg. 29 and ‘ tres
alii‚’ and ‘ viderunt' of the other MSS.
Priscian has ‘ videreut.’—I think that
there is no sense in Iordan's reading. The
passage may be some way corrupt.

60. judicium -— publicum] Ferra‘cci,
quoted by Klotz, remarks that Verres, as
‘ praetor urbanus,' acted quite consistently
in presiding at this trial, because it did not
belong to any of the special cases (quaes-
tiones) in which the other praetors were
commissioned to preside. This 15 true,· but
Cicero is not finding fault with his presid-
ing : he is blaming the motives for the pro-
secution.

ffiztercmsisset] One of the ‘ leges' of
Sulla deprived the ‘ tribuni plebis ' of the
power of doing mischief, as Cicero expresses

under certain limitations, which Opimius
by not observing had made himself liable to
a penalty.—‘ re vera’ is not in any MS„
and rests on the authority of Priscian only.
But if there is no authority for ‘ re vera,'
except Priscian, why should Orelli follow
Hotmann in taking ‘ re,' part of Priscian's
reading, and reject the rest ?

laedendique εἰκῇ] Zumpt, Klotz, and
Iordan have ‘sunt.' But if the rule for
the use of the subjunctive in hypothetical
sentences as laid down 111 Key’s Grammar
(1213, ake.) is correct, and it appears to be
so, this is not a case in which an indicative
can be used in the second clause. ‘ Sint '
is Ernesti's correction, which is consistent
with usage, for Cicero would only have to
call on many, in case he should choose to
tell all. The passage of Cicero Pro Flacc.
c. 5 (quoted by Zumpt), ‘ oratio inea potest:
&c., does not appear to be properly com-
pared, for ‘potest’ expresses a possibility
dependent on what is said in the other
clause, ‘si mihi libeat ;' nor is the other
passage, which he cites, aptly compared
(Tuscul. iv. 31), “‘si ridere concessum sit,
vituperatur tamen cachinnatio ;'’ where Ci-
cero means to say that ‘ cachinnatio' is in
all cases ‘ vituperanda!

ut levissime diatim] ‘ut levissime ap-
pellem’ Zumpt, from Lg. 29.-‘apud
ipsum :⁵ ‘ apud istum ipsum,' Prisc„ Iordau.

Is milii] See Lib. 2. c. 42, ‘Is mihi,’
Ake„ and also Lib. 2. c. 32.
