488 IN O. VERREM

lum Romanum hominibus novis industriis libenter honores mandare
semperque mandasse. Non est querendum in hac civitate quae
propter virtutem omnibus nationibus imperat virtutem plurimum
posse. Sit apud alios imago P. Africani3 ornentur alii mortui
virtute ac nominc ε talis ille vir fuit, ita de populo Romano meritus
est, ut non uni familiae sed universae civitati commendatus esse
debeat, Est aliqua mea pars virilis, quod ejus civitatis sum quam
ille amplam, illustrem, claramque, reddidit3 praecipue quod in his
rebus pro mea parte versor quarum ille princeps fuit, aequitate,
industria, temperantia, defensione miserorum, odio improborum:
quae cognatio studiorum et artium propemodum non minus est
conjuncta quam ista qua vos delectamini generis et nominis.
XXXVIII. Repeto abs te, Verres, monumentum P. Africani:
causam Siculorum quam suscepi relinqu03 judicium de pecuniis
repetundis ne sit hoc tempore3 Segestanorum injuriae negligantur:
basis P. Scipionis restituatur; nomen invicti imperatoris incidatur,
signum pulcherrimum Karthagine captum reponatur. Haec abs
te non Siculorum defensor, non tuus accusator, non Segestani pos-
tulant; sed is qui laudem gloriamque P. Africani tuendam conser-
vandamque suscepit. Non vereor ne hoc officium meum P. Servilio
judici non probem, qui quum res maximas gesserit, monumentaque

his first edition. Most of the MSS. have
‘ Ne ista,’ which caused some of the older
commentators a difficulty, as they did not
perceive that ‘ne' is an adverb of affir-

z'magyo] ‘Let others have the bust or
effigies of P. Scipio! The word ‘imago’
(εἰκών) is explained by Polybius, vi. 53.
‘ Imagines’ were masks of wax. See the

mation, which we now distinguish from
the dehortatory ‘ ne,’ by writing it with a
diphthong. It is doubtful if we should
write ‘nae.’ Klotz-reads ‘Aliquando ista
praeclara,’ which in his Preface he main-
tains to be the true reading, as (leduced
from the indications of the MSS. Lg. 29
has ‘ deinde: and it now appears that the
reading of R also means ⁵ deinde.³

bominibus novis] Cicero means him-
self ‚and others like himself. He was a
‘homo novus? See Lib. 3. c. 4.

in hac civitate quae] The common read-
ing is ‘ in ea,' &c. It is clear to those who
have attended to the use of the pronounS,
that ‘ in hac civitate quae . . imperat,' the
demonstrative ‘hac’ is required, and R λ
G2 Ld. have ‘haef The dett. have ‘ ea?
If Cicero meant to say ‘in a city that
rules,’ meaning any city, he would say, or
could say, ‘in ea civitate quae . . imperet,'
and Ι now find that Lg. 29 has ‘ i1npe1·et,'
a ‘lectio notabilis? which Zumpt had not

noticed.

note Lib. 5. c. 14.

Est aliqua mea] The glory and name
of P. Scipio belonged to the Roman peo-
ple; but Cicero says, ‘I have some share
in it, a full share or portion, because I
belong to a state which he made great,
illustriouS, and renowned 3 particularly
because 1 take my full share in those
things in which he was a model, in equity,
painstaking, sels-restraint, and the de-
fence of the unfortunate.'
virilis ³ see Lib. 3. c. 3.

in his rebus] ‘in his ’ codd„ but Iordan
writes ‘in iis.5 ‘ Rebus ' is the reading of
R 3. The dett. have ‘ artibus.5

conjuncta] ‘i. e. arta' (Zumpt), who
refers to a like use of ‘ conjunctus,' in the
Ep. ad Div. iii. 10. He also refers to the
speech of Iphicrates to the Athenians,
about the descendants of Harmodius (Aris-
totle, Rhct. ii. 23, ed. Bekker). -The
reader however will not find much for
the trouble of seeking the passage.
