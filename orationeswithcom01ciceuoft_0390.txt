elusisset.” If Verres had done this, he would
have avoided the trial, it is truc 5 but if the
money had been paid by Apronius, or 36-
knowledgcd to 116 received by Scandilius,
this would have been a clear admission that
Apronius said what 116 was charged with
saying 3 and the guilt of Verres would have
116611 35 61631· 35 it could have been made by
the evidence of Apronius. The meaning of
‘sponsionem acceptam facere’ cannot be
what Zumpt says. See the Excursus on
SPONSIONES.

But there is another obj ection to this in-
terpretation of Zumpt. Cicero says that
Verres did not compel Apronius ‘sponsio-
nem acceptam facere3' and, by not doing
this, he impudently disappointed the expec-
tations of those in court, who were waiting
to hear this curious affair. If then Verres
had compelled Apronius ‘sponsionem ac-
ceptam facere,5 the expectation would not
have been disappointed ς the matter would
have been heard. Thereforc ‘sponsionem
acceptam facere ³ is something which, if
done, would have been followed by a trial,
and would 113116 satisfied people's expecta-
tions.

The interpretation of P. Manutius is
right, which Forcellini (v. Acceptus) warns
us against aecepting. “ Facere,” says Ma-
nutius, “pro persequi. Quod, inquit, non
facis: in quo tollis exspectatum existima-
tionis tuae judicium, quia scire homines
cupiebant quid de tuacxistimatione decerne-
retur. Hoc igitur est in quo primum pec-
cas, quod Scandilium non cogis litem per-
sequi : alterum quod Apronio non permittis
ut quos velit de tua cohorte recuperatores
sumat? The meaning of ‘ sponsionem
facere ³ is carefully examined by Keller,
Semestr. i. p. 30, &a

The explanation of Zumpt, which must
bc rejected by virtue of the very form of
Cicero's argument, assumes that ‘spon-
sionem ³ here means the money 3 and it
may be admitted that ‘sponsio’ can have
this meaning. But Cicero 1135 used the
word ‘ sponsio ³ before in the ordinary
sense. Gaius (iv, 93). when 116 speaks of
the ‘ sponsio: ternis the money the ‘ summa

Cogit enim Scandilium quinque illa millia nummum dare

sponsionis? But 1 do not rely on this, for,
as already observed, ‘ sponsio' can bc used
in the sense of the money, which is the
subject of the ‘ sponsio?

utrisque] This word makes a difficulty,
for it is supposed that it should be ‘utri-
quc.' Zumpt says that this is the only
passage in Cicero where two persons are
called ‘ utrique ³ in the plural number. He
cites from Livy, xxx. 8, ‘ utraque cornua ;'
and xlii. 54, ‘utraque oppida ς’ and some
instances from other writers. In Lib. 4.
c. 14. there is ‘ binos . . . utrosque,’ where
I take ‘binos ³ to mean ‘ two,' a pair. But
in this passage φ 311(1 V have ‘utrique‚'
which Iordan has printed.

Coyit em’m Scandilium] Klotz has a
note on this passage, in which he acts the
part of the defender of Verres, and shows
his legal skill: “ Since Scandilius would not
accept the ‘ recuperatores ' from among the
Roman citizens, who had come with Verres
into the province, whom Verres (‘ negat 56
(16 existumatione sua cuiquam nisi suis
connnissurum,' and ‘cohortem proponis ³)
expressly chose to name, it was quite
equitable that 116 lost his wager, and was
compelled to pay to Apronius the amount
placed 011 the hazard. It is true that, with
respect to that declaration, Scandilius may
not have been so much in the wrong, but,
according to strict law, he must lose his
cause if he had not confidence enough to
have the matter investigated before the
‘judices’ of V erres.'' Can any man in his
senses suppose that Cicero would state a
case against Verres in such terms that the
obvious and only conclusion must be that
Verres was quite in the right? It makes
no matter that this speech was not deli-
vered. Cicero was not so dull as to state a
thing which he intended to be for him, in

such a way that 3 modern commentator can .

declare that the statement is direct against
him. Scandilius claimed the appointment 1
of ‘ recuperatores ³ from the ‘ conventus,' in
which he may have been right or wrong.
Let it 116 either way. Verres would only ap-
point from his own ‘ cohors 3' he would not
trust his reputation to any other persons
