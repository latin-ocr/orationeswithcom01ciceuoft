LXI. Quid potuit elegantius facere praetor cupidus existima-

tionis bonae, qui ab se omnem

suspicionem propulsare, qui se

eripere ex infamia cuperet Ρ Adductus erat in sermonem, invidiam,
vituperationem: dictitarat homo improbus atque impurus Apronius
socium esse praetorem: venerat res in judicium atque discrimen:

than those about him 3 not to a single man in Cicero. The proceeding of Verres was
in all Sicily. ch do not know enough pro· neither equitable nor legal 3 and the defence

bably of the mode of appointing ‘recupe-
ratores ' to understand the whole matter ς
but we know that there was a ‘rejectio’ or
challenge allowedof acertain number among
those who were proposed. thether Verres
could legally propose his own ‘cohors,' 1
don't know. Perhaps he could legally do
this (c. 61, at the end), but it was not the
practice of good governors at least. If
then the ‘ praetor' acted according to strict
law, he did not act conformably to the no-
tion of right, for the question should have
been tried by impartial persons. Scandi-
lius, says Cicero, positively refused to have
the matter tried by the ‘ recuperatores ’ of
Verres. He resisted the authority of the
court. Perhaps he was wrong 111 that.
that then? What is the next step? He
had in effect refused to exercise his chal-
lenge 3 we may even allow that he refused
to have any thing to do with the appoint-
ment of the ‘recuperatores.’ Did that jus-
tify Verres in pronouncing against him?
Can the German editor prove, that because
he refused to aeknowledge the ‘recupe-
ratores: he must therefore 110 condemned
by Verres, who, it must be remembered,
had nothing to do with the matter beyond
the appointment of the ‘ recuperatores ?'
Verres ought to have appointed the ‘ recu-
peratores: or allowed them to be named hy
Apronius ; that is, 110 ought to have ap-
pointed the ‘recuperatores ’ 111 1110 way
which 110 declarcd to be the proper way,
whatever way that was 3 and the trial ought
to have proceeded before these ¹ recupera-
tores? We are not bound to assume or
admit that the ‘recuperatores' were knaves ;
they might have turned out honest 10011 3
they might have decided for Scandilius,
whether they were honest or dishouest ; for
who could tell what they would do until
they had done it? lt was their duty to
pronounce the judgment; not the office of
Verres- It was the office of Verres to see
that the trial procceded in (1110 form; aud
· he would not let the trial proceed (spon—
siones . . ab ipso prohibitas judicari). It
did not proeeed in due form. Verres deli-
vered judgment, which was not his func-
tion. All this is clearly stated or implied

of it is altogether absurd.

As authority goes further with some pec--
ple than reason, 1 quote the following brief
exposition from a learned jurist (Rudorff,
Zeitsehrift fur Geschichtliche Rechtsw. xii.
p. 153)2 “ It was well known, by the state-
ments of Apronius himself, that he was in
partnership with Verres, and shared with
him the unjust gains, for the getting of
which Verres had lent him his official au-
thority. Already, under the administratiou
of Verres, this connexion between him and
Apronius was talked about. P. Rubrius,
and after him Scandilius, had challenged
Apronius to a ‘sponsio ' upon this alleged
partnership. Scandilius had compelled him
to enter into a ‘sponsio,' and Verres had
only eontrived to save himself from the
damage with which he was threatened by
this matter being brought to a hearing, by
compelling Scandilius, without judgment,
and wrongfully, to pay the amount of
the ‘restipulatio,' instead of appointing a
‘judex ' or ilnpartial ‘ recuperatore3,’ or re-
mitting the case to Rome.'' Keller also
says 011 the words “ ‘ Cogit . . . Apronio‚' hoc
est, opinor, restipulationis summam Scandi-
lium condennth

Cicero says (c. 62), “attuli sponsiones
ipso praesente fau-tas de decumarum socie-
tate, ab ipso prohibitas judicari ;'' where
‘de societate decumarum? as in 0. 61, means
1110 alleged partncrship of Apronius and
Verres.

The truth of Cicero's statement is im-
material for the understanding of this
passage. He means to tell us that Verris
committed a monstrous act of illegaliiy.
It is almost inconceivuble how some mo-
dern critics misunderstand 111101 they read.
They are so much occupied with their
own 11011005, which are foreign to the
matter, that they are quite unable to
understand what their author says. Their
object is that which is well described hy
0110 of the Delphin editors iu his presace :
to illustrate themselves first, and then their
author.
