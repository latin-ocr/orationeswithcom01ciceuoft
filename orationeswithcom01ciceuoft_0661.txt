SICILY A ROMAN PROVINCE. 641

Besides the ‘ decumae ³ payable by the cultivators in the ‘ decumanae
civitate& and, as we have seen also, by the cultivators who were domi-
ciliated within the limits of the states which were free from this charge,
there were other demands made on the Sicilians. Cicero has summed
them up thus: “ quum unae decumae lege et conditione detrahantur,
alterae novis institutis propter annonae rationem imperentur, ematur
praeterea frumentum quotannis publice, postremo etiam iu cellam ma-
gistratibus et legatis imperetur3 quid aut quantum praeterea est quod
aut liberum possit habere ille arator ac dominus in potestate suorum
fructuum aut in ipsis fructibus solutum ” (Lib. 3. c. 98).

The ‘ unae decumae ’ are the tenths of which we have already spoken.
There were, says Cicero (Lib. 3. c. 70), two modes of purchasing corn
when the necessities of Rome required a. larger supply than the ‘ unae
decumae.’ A second tenth (alterae decumae) was bought from the
Decumanae civitates. The price paid for the ‘ alterae decumae ’ was three
sestertii the modius. This was ‘frumentum emptum.’ Corn was also
required from the other ‘ civitates,'„ and the demand was imposed on all,
in proportion to the produce of their territory, as wc may suppose. This
corn was paid for by the Roman state somewhat highcr, three and a half
sestertii the modius, if the reading is right: this was the ‘frumentum
imperatum! The amount of the ‘ emptum’ was of course equal to that
of the ‘ unae decumae ' or regular tenths. The amount of the ‘ impera-
tum,’ while Verres was praetor, was eight hundred thousand modii of
wheat. The ‘imperatum' was imposed on all the ‘civitates,' as the
words of Cicero show, and the example of Halesa (Lib. 3. c. 723), which
was one of the ‘ immunes ac liberae.' Cicero makes it a charge against
Verres, that he did not require from the Mamertini (Messana) the
portion of ‘frumentum imperatum‚’ which they were bound to supply.
He adds, that corn had never been purchased in Sicily on the public
account without the Mamertini being required to furnish their proportion,
until Verres, from corrupt motives, rclieved them of this comparatively
light imposition (Lib. 5. c. 21). Messana was one of the Foederatae
civitates.

Cicero‘s words taken literally mean that besides the ‘ alterae decumae ²
which were bought from the Decumanac civitates, these states were
liable to the ‘imperatum :' “emendi duo genera fuerunt; unum deeu-
marum3 alterum, quod praeterea civitatibus aequaliter esset distribu-
tum ;'' and I have understood the passage so (Lib. 5. c. 21, note). I
am not quite sure that this is Cicero’s meaning, but Ι think that it is.

This commission to purchasc corn in Sicily became under the admi-
nistration of Verres a means of gross oppression, which Cicero has
explained (Lib. 3. c. 70—80).

The ‘frumentum aestimatum ’ (Lib. 23. c. 81) was the corn, wheat and
