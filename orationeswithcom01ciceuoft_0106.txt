88 IN O. VERREM

suae pudentem exitum quaesisse videatur. Patior, judices, et non

either affirmatively or negatively, according
to the words to which we suppose it to
refer. This apparent inconsistency is ex-
plained by considering ‘inuno’ to be a
shorter form of ‘in inodo,' for ‘modus ³ is
a word that is very often attached to
.another word. There is ‘ admodmn,' ‘ dum-
modo‚' ‘tantummodo,' ‘ ejusmodi‚' &e.
‘ 111100 ² is an example of ‘in ' attached to
another word of ordinary use (in 1000).
‘ Immo' may be taken in this passage as an
affirmation, strengthened by ‘ver0,’ as in
the phrase ‘ ego vero 3' and it refers to the
word ‘ adesse? ‘ Yes, indeed, let him
appear, let him answer.5 In 0. 32, there
is again ‘Immo vero ab hominibus,' dxc„

here a reference to the preceding sentence
shows that it may be translated 3 ‘No,
indeed, not 5ο, but by men of the gentlest
disposition.5 In Aet. ii. Lib. 4. 0. 42,
“ Quid hoc nos dicimus P Immo vero ipse
praesens :'’—‘ Well, is it I who say this?
No, indeed, he is here himself to say it?
Comp. Act. ii. Lib. 4. c. 46. In Act. ii.
Lib. 3. 0. 10, “Quid omne? plus immo
ctiam, inquit, si volet :''-—‘ What all ἶ) yes,
and more too, he says, if he shall ehoose!
The literal rendering would be, ‘ What all Ρ

the use of ‘ immo’ occur in Terence 5 as in
Andr. 3, 5, 12, “PA. Nempe ut modo.
D. immo melius spero :³'ss‘Ps Ay, as
you did just now. D. No, better Ι hope ς’
or, ‘Yes, and better I hope.' It is often
indifferent whether a man says Yes or No
to a question, if he adds something by way
of explanation 3 for neither Yes nor No
alone fully expresses what he has to say.

must Davus be considered as answering?
‘Well, do you understand this, 01· don’t
you yet understand even this? ‘Yes,'
says Davus, replying to the first part, ‘I
understand it very well.5 ‘No,’ says
Davus, replying to the second part, ‘I do
understand it very well.’ The following
passage is clear: Hauton. 1, 1, 4, “ M.

‘Yes, Ι had, Chremes ε’ where ‘No’ is a
denial of ‘have ς’ ‘Yes’ is an affirmation
of ‘had' ‘Modo' is often a monosyl-
lable in the verse of Terence, which shows
that the Romans in speaking abbreviated
it, like many other words. They would pro-
nounce ‘in modo,' ‘imm0,' and so they
wrote it ; and they might on the same prin-
ciple have written ‘ dummodo,' ‘ dmnmo?

The MSS. abbreviation of ‘ modo ’ is ίῨ)

written ho, αῇ in the specimen in
Lachmann’s edition.

It has been objected (Parry's Terence,
p. 52) to this explanation of ‘immo ’ that
the expression ‘in modo' does not occur.
That objection is weighty, if ‘immo’ is
not ‘in modo? But if ‘immo’ is ‘in
modo,' then the objection is not true. It
is also asked if the ‘ ablative modo' ever
occurs as a monosyllable in Plautus or
Terence. The answcr is that ‘modo ³ does,
and people may call it ablative or not, as
they like. The true form of the word is
‘ immo ³ as far as I can ascertain, and not
‘imo.' But the critics are not agreed on
this matter. There is however no doubt
about the way in which ‘immo ’ 15 used 3
and the suggestion that it is a cor-
relative word to ‘ sumnms,' and means ‘in
the lowest ‹legrec,’ ‘by no meam,5 is a
false explanatum, soi· it will spoil the
