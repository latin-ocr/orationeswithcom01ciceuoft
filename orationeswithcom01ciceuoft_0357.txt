himself King of Sicily, or that Cicero
meant to say that he did.

pervagatum et pervulgatum est,] The
reading of V. Zumpt has in his text
‘ Sicilia pervulgatum est 3’ and also Iordan.
In his Appendix, where he notiees the
readings of V, Zumpt tells us to read
‘Sicilia pervagatum est.' It is perhaps
doubtful if we ought to keep both words.

versus· plurimi] It seems that Verres
could not cheek the propensity to pasqui-
uades, 111 which the Romans have always
indulged; for wc may presume that 1110
‘versus ' were Roman rather than Greek,
though 1 would not pretend 11) decide so
important a question. The)v were written
above the seat (tribunal) where the Praetor
sat in court. Plutarch 10115 a like story of
words being written on 1110 seat of M.
J unius Brutus, for another purpose, when
he was Praetor (Brutus, e. 9). But 1110
Sicilians had their songs about l’ipa (Lib.
5. c. 31), and a taste for humour (De Or.
ii. 54).

adumbratum] Husband 111 name. It is
a painter’s term, but it does not mean to
make a mere outline, though originally the
word may have meant to take a likeness by
means of a shadow. It seems sometimes
to be used generally of a picture or like-
ness. So Aeschrio was the portrait or like-
ness of Pipa's husband 3 but 110 was not tho

real husband.

reeidisset,]
sedisset: which Klotz and Iordan adopt.
The common reading of the MSS. is ‘re-
disset. ’

licita· sunt] Here we have 1111 instance
of a communiti bidding for 1110“111(1111110.’

——‘suprajeeit’ is the reading of Lg. 42,
111111 probably the true reading. See Zumpt’s
note. The common reading, and that of
V, is ‘supra a(ljeeit.’——‘ et eo magis quod :¹
‘adeo magis quod,' Υ.

I have followed Zumpt 111 1110 numerals,
and they are consistent.

de eapite] ‘from the total.' ‘Caput'

interest is paid: ‘quinas hie ‹·apiti mer-
