EDICTA MAGISTRATUU‘M. 185

Repentinum, and a passage of Cicero (In Verr. Act. ii. Lib. 3. c. 14)
is quoted to prove this3 but the passage certainly does not justify the
conclusion. It does not appear that Edictum Repentinum occurs as
a genuine Roman expression, at least not as a technical expression.

It was the general practice for a Praetor to adopt in his Perpetuum
Edictum the rules which had been established by his predecessor. He
could not well do otherwise; for a rule when declared in the Edictum
was not an arbitrary or capricious rule‚ as we have seen3 it was only an
authoritative mode of giving a legal character to something already
observed as a rule among the people‚ or of establishing some rule, the
necessity of which was generally felt. A Praetor then could not, consist-
ently with the honest discharge of his office, reject any good rule which
was established by his predecessor; but, as he was not bound by his pre-
decessor’s practice, he was at liberty to reject that of which he did not
approve. If a Praetor had any disposition to declare rules in bis Edict
which were unjust, he was checked by regard to opinion, and by his
responsibility after the expiration of his year of office. It was a ground
of complaint against Verres that he made new rules in matters that were
already settled by his predecessors, and to which he ought to have made
his Edictum consormable (In Verr. Lib. 1. c. 40—4'7). The general
practice of making the new Edictum conformable to what was already
established, gave to the Edictum a certain degree of fixedness. Such
edictal rules as a Praetor adopted from the Edictum of his predecessor
were called Edictum Translatitium (In Verr. Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 45). By the
addition of a new rule, as circumstances called for them, the Edictum
was continually enlarged3 and old rules which were found to be useless
or injurious were dropped. And all this was donc before the eyes of a
people ever watchful over the conduct of their Magistratus, who were
men chosen out of their own body, to which they returned aster the
expiration of their annual office; and with the advice and assistance of
persons learned in the Law (jurisprudentes).

Some Praetors, however, while they eseaped the censure of framing a.
rule for particular occasions, with which Cicero charges Verres, did
almost as much mischief in another way. Instead of abiding by their
Edictum Perpetuam, they mado additions to it from time to time during
their year of office, or altered it. But this practice was checked, ac. 67,
by a Cornelia Lex, which required Magistratus to administer justice
during their year of office conformably to their Edictum Perpetuam, or
the Edict published on entering on their office ⁸.
