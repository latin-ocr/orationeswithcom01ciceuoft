tain of Arethusa, now a much diminished
source, in which the nymphs of modern
Syracuse wash their dirty linen. Pietro
della Valle (Let. 15, Ρ. 111.) saw them at
work, and others have seen them.

The Greeks had 0 legend for every
striking natural phenomenon, and they
told how the nymph Arethusa, being pur-
sued by the AlpheuS, was changed into a
fountain by Diana, to save her from the
amorous river-god (Ovid, Met. V. 639) :

‘⁶ Delia rumpit humum. Caecis ego mersa
cavei-ms
Advehor Ortygiam 3 quae me cognomine
divae
Grata meae superas eduxit prima sub
auras.”

The nymph changed into a fountain,
plunged into the cavern, and emerged
from the sea in the island of Ortygia.

Diodorus (V. 4) speaks of this fountain,
and of its sacred fish, which were protected
even to his time, the reign of Augustus.
He observes that persons who had eaten of
these fish, in times when the city was sur-
rounded by an enemy, suffered from the
deity for their daring irreverenee. Strabo
speaks of the Arethusa as “flowing into
the sea, a very river at its source.'' It is
much less copious now. Strabo refutes the
story of the river Alpheus flowing under
the sea, by serious arguments.

“At the distance of about eighty feet
from this fountain (Arsethu a), a copious
spring, called L’Ocehio della Zilica, and
probably derived from the same source,
rises from the bottom of the harbour (dis-
tinguishable only on very calm days) with
such force, that it does not intermingle
with the salt water until it gains the sur-
face '³ (Smyth's Sicily, p. 171).

“ Sic tibi quum fluctus subter labere Si-
canos,
Doris amara suam non intermisceat un-
dau1.''—Virg. Eclog. x. 4.

Perhaps some readers may not 500 the
exact signification of ‘extrema,' which I
have explained by the translation. The
same form occurs a little further on : ‘ quam
ad summam? ‘on the top of which;' an
expression that few readers will 1)0 1101)Ιο to

mistake. The other, ‘in insula extrema}
‘ on the outer side or margin‚' 15 sometimes
mistaken. The Greek has the same form
in ἔσχατος, which contains the root ἐκ 01
ἐξ 2
ἔστιν πόλις Κάνωβος ἐσχάτη χθονός.

Canobus, on the margin of the sea.
prytanium,] The Greek πρυτανεῖον, 0
word of perhaps doubtful origin. Herodo-
tus (vii. 197) observes that the Achaeans
called their Prytaneium by the term LeIton

(λήϊτον), which is as much as to say Pub· -

licum : but we have no modern equivalent.
The Romans kept their perpetual fire burn-
ing in the temple of Vesta; the Greeks· 111
their Prytaneium. But-1 Pry taneium w 05
used, at Athens at least, for other purposes
besides the 0011501· v ation of the 01 er· -burning
fire . it 1105 used for public entertainments
to foreign ambassadors ς and it appears
that a regular table was kept there for
those to 1111001 the state granted free eom-
mons.

Zumpt quotes Livy (xli. 20) : “ Cyzici iu
prytaneum, id est penetrale urbis, ubi pub-
lice quibus is honos datus est vescuntur ;''
and he refers to the note of Casaubon,
Athenaeus, xv. 0. 60, p. 700.

Cicero has not translated Prytaneium,
for the Romans had not the thing. The
Roman word Curia is the translation of
the Greek βουλευτήριον, for it appears
from c. 61, that it was the meeting-place
of what he calls the Senatus (βουλή) of
Syracuse. The official title of a Greek
connnunity was ἡ βουλὴ καὶ ὁ δῆμος, 05 of
Rome it was Senatus Populusque Roma-
nus (Lib. 4. 0. 10).

Jovis Olympii : ceterae] The passage
stands thus in Zumpt ε ‘ J ovis Olympii,
ceteraeque urbis parteS, quae una,' &c.
He has added ‘ quae ’ from the best MSS„
but it is not easy to explain. Zumpt
observes, if we retain the common reading,
that 15, if wc (10 not accept the ‘ quae,’ we
cannot tell what to do with the ‘ que.' 1

thus all becomes plain : ‘ 1110 remaining
parts of the city being divided by one broad
continuous street, and many cross streets
are occupied by private lmildings.’——‘ cae-
