LEX VOCONIA. 175

The prohibitions of the Lex Voconia appear to be very singular, and
. indeed absurd, when we consider how easily they could be evaded. A
man who was ‘census‚’ and whose property was 100‚000 Sestertii or
upwards, could not make a woman his ‘heres,’ not even an only
daughter3 yet, if he died intestate, his daughters had a share in the
succession equally with their brothers3 and a daughter, if she was the
only child, would take all. Further, if the testator, who was ⁶ census,'
and whose property amounted to 100‚000 Sestertii, made (instituit) a
daughter ‘heres,’ the ‘institutio’ being invalid made the testament
invalid, and the consequence wasa, that the daughter would be ‘heres ab
intestato,’ that is, she would take the property which it was the object
of the Lex to prevent her from taking. Two solutions of this difficulty,
or apparent contradiction, are proposed; one by Savigny‚ and one by
Hugo3 neither of which is perhaps satisfactory. That this contradic-
tion did exist appears from the words of Philus (Cicero, De Re Publica,
iii. 10), “cnr—P. Crassi filia posset habere, si unica patri esset, aeris
milliens, salva lege, mea triciens non posset.’⁷ Savigny doubtless has
given the right explanation of the words, when he says that they refer
to a case of intestacy. The daughter of Crassus, if he had only one
daughter, might by his dying intestate succeed to his immense property
of one hundred milliens of Sesterces3 but Philus, who had a much
smaller property, and several children, could not give his daughter more
than the share that she would take by his intestacy3 sor he could
give her nothing as testamentary ‘heres’ The Vesta] Virgins could
make a testament3 and the prohibitions of the Lex Voconia did not
apply to them. (Cic. De Ro Publica, iii. 10; Gell. i. 12.)

But the Lex was perhaps not so inconsequent as it appears at first
sight. The Romans were fond os making testaments, as most peopleare.
The case of intestacy therefore, though not provided sor by the Lex
Voconia, would be comparatively rare. The Lex was a limitation of a
man's testamentary power, and this would certainly bo disliked. The
legislator might be satisfied with limiting this power, without ventnring
to make any innovation on tho rights of those who claimed ‘ab intes-
tato.’ lf a rich father, for instance, wished an only daughter to enjoy
a larger portion of his property than tho Lex allowed him to give by
testament, he must bo content to die intestato. If he did make a will,
and was ‘census,' he must observc the rules of the Lex. 110 could
give his daughter a limited legaoy, but not make her ‘ he1·es.'

Tho cssay of Savigny was written in 15203 and ho has added to
it a few remarks written in 1849. Numerous writers have attempted
to explain this Lex; and Savigny mentions as ono of the best, llasse
(Rhein. Mus. fiir Jurisprud. 3⁰¹ Jahrgang, 1829, pp. 1³2—214). 'she
latest essay which I have seen is by Dr. J. J. Bachoi'en, Basel‚ 1813.
