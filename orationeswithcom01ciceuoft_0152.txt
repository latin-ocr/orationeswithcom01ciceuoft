of Cilicia3 but that is all. It is also said
that P. Servilius Isauricus first established
a province of Cilicia in 13.c. 75 after his
conquests 111 Lycia, Pamphylia, and Isau-
ria, but even this province of Cilicia does
not appear to have comprehended more
than a very small part⁴ of mountainous
Cilicia. The real annexation to the Roman
empire of the two eountries named Cilicia
was the work of Cn. Pompeius Magnus
in B.C. 67 311(1 66. The Romans then
seem before B.c. 66 to have used the name
Cilicia Provincia to indicate their most
remote provincial government 111 Asia,

with a view to the possession of Cilicia,
when they could get it.

(Becker, Rom.

his nominibus] ‘Nomen' (c. 36) is a
word which signifies ‘heads' or ‘ entries ³
iu a book of accounts, which entries would
contain the names of persons and other
circumstances. Hence ‘nomen' is used
generally for a head or title of account.
Savigny (Ver-mischte Schriften, i. 213)
shows that the Roman expression, ‘nomina
facere' (Inst. iv. tit. 21; Cic. De Off. 111.
14), signifies the contracting that ‘obli-
gatio’ which the Romans called the ‘ obli-
gatio literis’ or ‘literarum-³ If we can
ascertain in what form the ‘nomina fa-
cere ' was made, we shall also ascertain in
what form the ‘obligatio literis' was ef-
fected. Many passages show that ‘ nomina
facere' is an entry 111 3 ‘codex’ or
‘tabulae,' vm'thout any reference to any
other documentary evidence than that
which the ‘codex' supplies (V err. Lib. i.
0. 36, 39; Ad Att. iv. 18; Seneca, De
Benef. iii. c.153 Cic. Pro Rosc. Com. c. 5).
In this last passage Cicero enumerates the
three strict forms of contract upon which
a ‘pecunia certa' could be sued for. He
says that it must be either ‘pecunia dat-a,'
a loan ; or ‘stipulata,' that is, the claim
must be founded on the peculial· Roman
contract called ‘ stipulatio 3’ or it must be
‘expensa lata‚’ that is, ‘expensilatiQ’ or
an entry in the ‘codexfl Such an entry
was itself the forming of the eontract. It
is true that ‘ tabulae,' like other writings,
could be used as evidence 5 but that does

Hoc scitote: his nominibus-quae res

not prove that entries might not be the con-
traet itself. A promissory note, 01· 3 11111
of exchange, in itself expresses an ‘obliga-
tio,' whatever other use may he made of it
as evidence. This ordinary ‘ codex accepti
et expensi,' which every man was expected
to keep, contained the 01111105, in the order
of time, of all a man's receipts and pay-
ments, with the matter to which the re-
ceipts and payments referred, and the
names of the persons from whom the sums
were received, or to whom they were paid.
Out of such a book or journal a man
might make a more formal book, in which
his transactions with each individua] might
be arranged under their several heads 3 but
this would be a different kind of book from
the ‘codex accepti et- expensi.’ As to the
‘literarum obligatio,’ it was the entry of
the creditor in his ‘codex' (expensilatio)
which made the ‘ obligatio,' and gave to it
its name, and not the entry of the debtor
111 1115 ¹ codex ³ (acceptilatio), which corre-
sponded to the entry of the creditor. The
difficulties that are obw'ous as to the. proof
of a debt in the case of an ‘ obligatio literis,'
have nothing to do with the nature of the
‘ obligatio,' which is clearly ascertained.
Nor is it supposed that a mere entry by a
man in his ‘ codex ³ (expensilatio) could
make another man his debtor. If debtor
and creditor were both honest men, the
‘ expensilatio ³ in the books of the one would
cor-respond to the ‘ acceptilatio ’ in the
books of the other. If they did not, there
must be evidence to prove that the ‘ex-
pensilatio' was properly made. This is
certain, that in the ‘obligatio literarum '
the creditor sued upon the entry in his
‘ codex,³ as the contract ς but this is quite
a different matter from the evidence that
he might have to produce in order to show
that the entry was made under such cir-
cumstances as would entitle the maker to
sue on it. (See Gaius, iii. 132.)

quae res effe] ‘ Quae res ⁹ refers to
‘ nomina,’ but ⁶ quae ³ alone would not have
expressed Cicero's meaning. It is explana-
tory of ‘ nomina,' and the meaning of
‘ quae ' 15 enlarged by the addition of ‘ res :’
‘ 011 these items or heads, I mean what he
did when he required of the cities corn,
skins, hair cloth, sacks,' &cu The skins
and hair cloths were for the use of the
army and navy. As to ‘quae res,' comp.
‘ quibus ego in rebus interfui,² c. 40.
