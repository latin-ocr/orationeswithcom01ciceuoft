generally, every defendant in any proceeding civil or criminal has the
beatitude of not being required to prove any thing.

There were two institutions of Roman Law, Usucapio and Interdicta,
which presupposed the existence of possession, and rendered it necessary
to determine the legal notion of possession. No other right except
these was derived from possession. He who was in possession of a
thing under certain conditions had the capacity os acquiring the owner-
ship of the thing in a given time by Usucapio, or uninterrupted enjoy-
ment. And he who was not in possession might have a right to the pos-
session, or, if he was in possession, and his possession was disturbed‚ 3
right to protection. Το both these cases the Interdicta applied. Aman
might be in possession, and yet unable to prove his title to the owner-
ship. If he was ejected by another person, and the ejector was then
considered to be in possession (in the legal sense), the party who was
ejected would have no remedy3 for by the supposition he could show no
title to the ownership. All ‘ possessio,’ whatever was its origin, was
protected, except when the ‘possessio’ had been obtained against a
former possessor ‘ vi,’ ‘ clam‚' or ‘ precario,’ as the Romans expressed it3
but these three excepted cases rendered it necessary in many instances
to determine which of two claimants must be considered to be in
possession, and to be entitled to the protection of the Interdicta. “ In
a dispute about ownership, the part which the two parties have to act
depends on possession : the present possessor has the advantage of
being the defendant, and his opponent has the ‘ onus petitoris.' If both
parties make claim to the possession, this matter must be settled first.
According to the oldest law there was no particular process for this
purpose, and the Praetor decided according to his judgment 3 but subse-
quently hc gave the Interdictum retinendae possessionis, iu consequence
of which, the question, Who is possessor Ρ was dccided in a. separate
trial: this, according to Ulpian‚ was the first occasion for the introduc-
tiQn of these interdicts ” (Puchta, Inst. ii. § 225).

The acknowledgment ofa right of possession in the Roman law led
the Roman jurists to the determination of the nature of that possession,
which was the foundation of the right. This subject has been explained
by Savigny, ‘ Das Recht des Besitzes‚’ which, besides explaining what
is peculiarly Roman, contains tho fundamental principles of the acquisi-
tion and loss of possession3 an exact acquaintance with which would
matcrially assist a legal student in analyzing the confused terminology
and the vague language employed on this subject by our judges in their
judgments and by our law writers in their treatises.
