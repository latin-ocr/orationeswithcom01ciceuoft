240 IN O. VERREM

quanto illud flagitiosius, improbius, indignius, eum a quo pecuniam
ob absolvendum acceperis condemnare, ut ne praedonum quidem
praetor in fide retinenda consuetudinem conservaret? Scelus est
accipere ab reo: quanto magis ab accusatore? quanto etiam scele-
ratius ab utroque? Fidem quum proposuisses venalem in provincia,
valuit apud te plus is qui pecuniam majorem dedit. Concedo: Ι
forsitan aliquis aliquando ejusmodi quidpiam fecerit. Quum vero

fidem ac religionem tuam jam alteri addictam pecunia accepta ”
habueris, post eandem'adversario tradideris majore pecunia, utrum-
que falles, et trades cui voles, et ei quem fefelleris ne pecuniam
quidem reddes Ρ Quem mihi tu Bulbum, quem Staienum, quod
unquam hujuscemodi monstrum aut prodigium audivimus aut vidi-
mus, qui cum reo transigat, post cum accusatore decidat? honestos
homines qui causam norint ableget a consilioque dimittat? ipse
solus reum absolutum a quo pecuniam acceperit condemnet pecu-
niamque non reddat? Hunc hominem in judicum numero habe-
bimus? hic alteram decuriam senatoriam judex obtinebit? hic de

thc verb, and it means as much as this:
‘that Bulbus, tell 1119 if you can, what
Staienus, what monster evcr of this kind,

it under the head “ Translate addictus est,
obstrictus, devinctus, obnoxius.” But this
is not the exact meaning. ‘ Addicere‚’ in

0119 of its usages, is a word used 111 sclling,
and signifies the declaration of him who
sells as to the transfer of the thing to the
buyer. ‘ Pretium ' is ‘price,' that which
the buyer gives. The passage means, ‘ to
have his good saith and conscience bar-
gained and sold for money? There is a
use of ‘addicere' in Lib. 5. c. 63, which
shows the sense of thc word ; and it is
common 111 the law writers. See also Lib.
3. 9. 33.

conservaret ἲ] ‘ conservet ³ Lg. 42 p. m.
Iordan.

quanto Ἰψηφὶς] All the ‘ cod. noti ' except
Lg. 29, which has ‘quanto majus,’ which
some may prefer.

Quem mihi {u Bulbum, cisa] These were
two of the inerccnary ‘judices ³ in the trial
of Oppianicus. Sec the oration Pro Cluen-
tio, 9. 26. 28, &cu A note of interrogation
is usually placed after Stalenus or Staienus
(perhaps the true name), which spoils the
sentence, for ‘ Bulbum, Staienum ’ dcpend
on ‘ audivimus ' and ‘ vidimus? Zumpt,
who places a note of interrogation after
‘ Staiemnn,' supplies ‘ dicis.' But this ar-
tifice will not always answer. The ⁵ mihi
tu‚' so placed, marks thc conti-ast of the
two persons, ‘ I, Cicer0,’ and ‘ you, Verres?
The original form of expression may have
had a verb on which ‘ mihi ' would depend,
bnt usage established the formula without

or what prodigious thing have we heard of
or have we seen, that comes to terius with
the accused‚ and then finally compromises
with the accuser?' Compare ‘Tu mihi,
quum circumsessus es,' δια, Act. ii. Lib. 1.
c. 32. ‘ Transigat ² and ‘ decidat ' are both
forensic words. ‘ Transigerc ’ is to settle a
matter with a person. Dig. 2. tit. 15, De
Transactionibus.

in judicum numero] Zumpt has a note
on this passage, 111 which he contcnds that
‘ 111 ³ is necessary 3 for the meaning is, as the
context shows, ‘ shall we allow this man to
be one of the Judiccs?’ but if ‘in' were
omitted, then the sense ought to be ‘to
consider him as a Judex? Now, if this
were the meaning, he contends that it
ought to be ‘numero judicis? He cites
two examples where the plural is used in
this sense, one from the Life of Agesilaus,
by Nepos, “mirari se non sacrilegorum nu-
mero haberi,” ‘he wondered that hc was
not considered a sacrilegious person ς’ and
another from Suetonius (Caesar, c. 11).
But he finds no such instance 111 Cicero,
who uses such a phrase as (Ad Q. Fr. i. 1.
9. 4) “ accensus sit co numero quo eum
majores nostri esse volucrunt 3³³ or hc says
‘ numero aliquo,' and the like.

decuriam] There were, it is said, three
‘ decuriac,' each consisting of one hundred
senators, out of which the ‘judices ’ were
