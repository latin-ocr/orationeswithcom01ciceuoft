‘Quid enim' begins an interrogative for-
mula, and that it requires a verb. But it
is also true that, in rapid and impassioned

speech, usage osten omitted the verb which
ought to go with ‘Quid eni1n,’ and the
speaker completed his meaning by the
enunciation of another verb. And this
second verb may be enunciated either as
an answer to the first verb suppressed‚ in
which ease it may be either an affirmation
or a negation; or it may be a continuation
of the interrogation, in Such a. form as
‘ Quid enim, ad amicosne confugiam P’
or as in Divin. e. 11, “Quid illa, Caecili,
contenmenthmc tibi videntur,” &a A like
remark applies to sentences beginning
with ‘ Quid crgo,' δια, as in the beginning
of c. 57.

CN. DOMITIVS ἄτη] The first two were
consors in B-C. 115, and their censorship
was distinguished for the great works con-
strue-ted during their office, and for the
strictness with which the censors per·
formed their duty of revising (legendi)
the sonate. Tho censorship of Cassius and
Servilius belongs to n.c. 125.

Qv1 DE L. Manem ᾦα] 'rho text, as
it stands in the Variormn edition, contains
‘redemerit emn’ aster ‘ consoribus: and
‘ei' twice after ‘n‹·vc,’ and is thus cx-
plained by Manutius and Gruter: “ lf any
person has taken a contraet from the cen-
sor·S‚ L. Marcius M. Perperna, no other
person must admit that person as a partucr,
nor give him a share in a contract, nor un-

one else bidding for him. Manutius is
wrong in supposing ‘ de ' in this passage to
be equivalent to ‘ post ; ' and his reason for
this explanation is, that, according to c. 50,
P. Junius had taken the contract from the
consul& Sulla and Metellus, and not from
the censorS‚ Marcius and Perperna. But
See the note on c. 50. Zumpt says that

here, is the reading of all the MSS. and all
