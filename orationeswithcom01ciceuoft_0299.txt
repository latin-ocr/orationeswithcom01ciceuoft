ACT. Π. LIBER SECUNDUS. 281

ego dignitate accusationem meam comprobare non potero? Nisi
forte quod apud publicanos gratiosus fuisti, in ea re spes te aliqua
consolatur. Quae gratia ne quid tibi prodesse posset ego mea dili-
gentia perfeci: ut etiam obesse deberet tu tua sapientia curasti.
Etenim rem totam, judices, breviter cognoscite. t

LXX. In scriptura Siciliae pro magistro est quidam L. Carpi-
natius, qui et sui quaestus causa, et fortasse quod sociorum inter-
esse arbitrabatur, bene penitus in istius familiaritatem sese dedit.
Is quum praetorem circum omnia fora sectaretur neque ab eo
unquam discederet, in eam jam venerat familiaritatem [consuetu-
dinemque] in vendendis istius decretis et judiciis transigendisque
negotiis ut prope alter Timarchides numeraretur. Hoc erat etiam
capitalior, quod idem pecunias iis qui ab isto aliquid mercabantur

following words, ‘eorum ego,' &a Zumpt
and Iordan have ‘ quorum auctoritate tu!
apud publicanos] V has ‘apud ad-
versus publicanos 3’ one of these words
is evidently a gloss of the other, or the
copyist had two readings before him, and
took both. Though ‘ apud ' is common in
such a formula as this, ‘ adversus ' is also
used 3 for ‘adversus' is simply ‘turned
towards,' and may be a friendly or a hostile
movement. Klotz has ‘ adversus)

70. scriptura] The ‘scriptura,' one of
the oldest sources of Roman revenue, con-
sisted of the payments made by those who
pastured their cattle on the public lands.
The name is derived from the circumstance
of those who pastured their cattle on these
lands being required to reg-ister (scribere)
their names, and the number and kind of
their animals, in respect of which they paid
a certain sum of money. This source of
revenue, like others, was let to the Publi-
cani, who paid the state a sum of money,
and collected the payments for themselves.

The Publicani formed ‘societates’ or
partnerships for the farming of this and
other sources of revenue ; and as the state
would often require the money paid at
once, the members of these ‘societates'
took shares in these undertakings, and
paid down their money. (Pro Rabirio
Post. e. 23 val. Max. vi. 9, 7; Polyb. vi.
17.) The affairs of such a ‘ societas' were
managed by a ‘magister' or ‘ director ’ at
Rome, and a ‘pro magistro' or deputy
director in the province or place where
the money was to be collected (comp. Cic.
Ad Att. xi. io). A person employed
in the collection was said ‘operas dare τ’
“ Canuleius . . qui in portu Syracusis operas

Terentius operas in portu et scriptura Asiae
pro magistro dedit ;’' where the ‘ pro ma-
gistro’ is said ‘ operas dare.’ A passage of
Valerius Maximus (vi. 9, n. 8) is quoted by
Garat-oni, where ‘ operas dare' is contrasted
with ‘ publicanum agere ε’ “Ρ. Rupilius non
publicanum in Sicilia egit, sed operas pub-
licanis dedit 3'' and the note in the edition
of Torrenius.

The two following extracts from the Lex
Thoria m'll illustrate the text. Cap. 42,
“ Mag. prove mag. queive pro eo inperio
iudicio suo quae publica Populi Romani in
Africa sunt eruntve vectigalia fruenda lo-
cabit vendetvc,’' &cu ς and “exlege dicta
quam L. Caeci. Cn. Dom. cens. quom
eoriun agrorum vectigalia fruenda locave-
runt legem deixcrunt, neive quod in eis
agi-eis pequs pascetur scripturae pecoris
legem deieito‚’' &tn

sora sectaretur] A ‘forum' is a sumu
connnunity, as Forum Julii in Italy, and
others. “ ‘ Fora‚' ⁴ conciliabula: ‘ castella,’
were places which in extent and import-
ance stood between towns and villages
(vici) ; they also belonged to the territory
of some town, and had corporate rights ''
(savigny, Systein, &c., ii. 251). This is
the meaning of ‘forum ' as a town; but it
may mean here all the ‘forth' that is, all
the towns in which there were ‘ fora?

familiaritatem] M. Lg. 42 omit this
word and the ‘ que ' after ‘ consuetudinem?
Zumpt and Iordan retain the wordS. Klotz
omits them.

capital ior,] Klotz observes, after Zumpt,
that ‘ capitalis: in the sense of ‘ pernicio-
811S,' is applied also to persons (Phil. ν. 12 ;
De offic. iii. 21) 3 and he adds, that in this
word ‘ capitalis' Cicero also alludes to the
