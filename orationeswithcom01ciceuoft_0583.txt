porro, tu, qui tam religiosum existimari te voluisti interpretem
foederum, cur Tauromenitanis frumentum, cur Netinis imperasti,
quarum civitatum utraque foederata est? Ac Netini quidem sibi
non defuerunt, ac simul pronuntiasti libenter te Mamertinis re-
mittere, te adierunt et eandem suam causam foederis esse docu-

erunt.

Tu aliter decernere eadem in causa non potuisti.

Pronun-

tias Netinos frumentum dare non debere, et ab his tamen exigis.
Cedo mihi ejusdem praetoris literas et rerum decretarum et fru-

menti imperati.

Quid potius in

hac tanta et tam turpi inconstantia suspicari possumus, judiees,

case of eviction, the surety was commonly
called ‘ auctor secundus ' (Dig. 21. 2. 4).

The uses of ‘ auctor ' and ‘ auctoritas‚' in
the Roman writers, are so copious, and so
closely connected with technical matters,
that a full explanation of them would go
beyond the limits of a note. ‘Auctor ³ con-
tains the root ‘aug‚’ to cause to wax or
grOW, to strengthen, confirm, and so forth.
One of the most common uses of ¹ auctor '
and ‘ auctoritas ’ appears in the case of ‘ pu-
pilli: for many of the acts of ‘ pupilli ’ were
not valid without the knowledge and con-
sent of a ‘tutor' whose experience and years
were intended to supply the defects in the
experience and years of the ‘ pupillus’ (Inst.
i. 21) z “ tutor autem statim in ipso negotio
praesens debet auctor fieri, si hoc pupillo
prodesse existimaverit.” The doctrine is
contained in the following words (Dig. 41.
2. 32. § 2) : “infans possidere recte potest,
si tutore auctore coepit, nam judicium in-
fantis suppletur auctoritate tutoris;'' and
in the following passage of Paulus (Dig. 26.
8. 3) : “ etiamsi uon interrogatus tutor auc-
tor fiat, valet auctoritas ejus quum se pro-
bare dicit id quod agitur ε hoc est enim auc-
torem fieri.’'

Generally then ‘ auctoritas ' is that
which gives to a. thing its efficiency or
completeness, according to the nature of
the case. There is ‘ auctoritas' in what a
man of good character says and does.
There is ‘ auctoritas ' in him who holds a
public office, and he has it by virtue of his
office. A trustworthy person, one on
whose evidence we can rely, is ‘ auctor
idoneus? Livy calls Polybius ‘auctor non
spernendus,' a man whose evidence and
statements may he rclied on. Compare
Lib. 4. e. 45, ‘ bono auctore) So we
have as an ‘ auctor ' one who sets an exam-
ple, as ‘unum cedo auctorem tui facti'
(c. 26, and elsewhere). ln c. 50, ‘ auc-
tores testesque produco.¹

There are other technical significatione

of ‘ auctor' and ‘auctoritas‚' the explana-
tion of which would be foreign to the
matter which is explained in this note ;
but a reference to them may be useful.
The phrase ‘ patres auctores ' (Livy, i. 17,
22, 32, and elsewhere) is explained by
Becker, Handbuch, ii. 1, p. 314, ae. The
difficulty lies in the application of the
term 3 but, in order to understand it, we
must recur to the sense of ‘ auct0r‚' which
has been already explained.

The meaning of ‘ auctoritas ’ follows that
of ‘auctor,’ for he who is ‘auctor’ gives
his ‘auctoritas.' Thus in the old Roman
legislation, the vote of the ‘ centuriae ' and
the ‘ auctoritas patrum ’ made a complete
act. The voting of a ‘lex,’ or the choice
of a person at an election, was made com-
plete by the ‘auctoritas patrum.' The
equivalence of the expressions ‘ auctor
fieri ' and ‘ fieri pati ' appears from Gaius
(i. 99): “quia et is qui adoptat rogatur,
id est, interrogatur, an velit eum quem
adoptaturus sit, justum sibi filium esse ; et
is qui adoptatur rogatur, an id fieri patia-
tur,¹' where hc is speaking of ‘adrogantia'
In the oration De Domo, c. 29. occurs the
expression ‘ auctorne esses,' which was the
old i'ormula, in the smne sense in which
Gaius says ‘ an id fieri patiatur!
pare also Gellius (v. 19).

As to the ‘ auctoritates ' of the Senatus,
see Becker, Handhuch, ii. 2, p. 441. The
extreme difficulty of finding adequate ex-
pressions for the word ‘ auctor' will appear
from a passage in this oration, e. 67, “ se-
natores . . . legum et judiciorum et juris
auctores.'' He who can give an adequate
translation of these words has learned
something of the Latin language, aad οἵ
Roman affliirs.

Ac Netini] ‘At 'Netini’ G 1 Zumpt,
1 now think that ‘ Ac Netini ' (Iordan) is
the true reading. As tu ‘ Netini ' see Lib.
3. c. 6.
