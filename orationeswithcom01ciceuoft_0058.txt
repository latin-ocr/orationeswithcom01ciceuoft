non ‘imperitos adolescentulos] Plutarch
(Life of 1130311115, 0. 1) z “ Lucullus, while
he was still a youth, before he was a candi-
date for a magistracy and engaged in public
life, made it his first business to bring to
trial his father's accuser, Servilius the
Augur, as a public offender ς and the
matter appeared to the Romans to be
creditable to Lucullus, and they used to
speak of that trial as a memorable thing.
It was indeed the popular notion, that to
prefer an accusation was a reputable
measure, even when there was no founda-
tion for it, and they were glad to see the
young 111011 fastening 011 old offenders, like
well-bred whelps laying hold of wild
beastsfl’

P. Lentulus,] Μ’ Aquillius, consul of
the year B.C. 129, was prosecuted for Repe-
tundae, on his return from Asia after the
defeat of Aristonicus. He was acquitted,
by bribing the ‘judicesss it is said (Appian,
Bell. Cz'v. i. 22). Τ1115 P. Lentulus was
the grandfather of P. Lentulus Sura, who
was str angled in prison in Cic'ero 5 consul-
ship, B. c. 63. Asconiuss 5355 that 110 was
thel father, but 110 15 mistakcn. Lentulus

15 here named Princeps Senatus. The
Princeps Senatus was the Senator whose
name was written first on the Censorian
list, and this distinction was usually given
to the oldest ‘ vir censorius.5 It was also
the general practice for the Princeps
Senatus to be first called on to deliver 1115
0111111011 111 the Senate on any matter in
(lebate, when there were no ‘consules
designati? (Becker, Handbuch, ii. 2. 399.

P.) Asrieamcs,] Africanus, the younger,
prosecuted L. Cotta in B.C. 131, at least
not earlier (for Scipio triumphed over the
Numantini B.C. 132). This L. Aurelius
Cotta also escaped‚ and by the same means
as Μ’ Aquillius (Appian, Bell. Civ. i. 22).
Cicero (Pro Murena, c. 28) attributes his
acquittal to the unwillingness of the ‘ju-
(11005 ' to allow a. man to be destroyed by
so terrible an opponent 35 8011110, 3 kind
of feeling of pity at the disproportion
between the power of the accuser and the
weakness of the accused. L. Cotta, the.
5011, who was consul B.C. 119, is supposed
to be the Cotta who is meant, and not the
father of the same name, who was consul
B.C. 144. (Meyer, Orat. Roman. Fraym.
p. 186, 500. ed.)

Jure, &ej ‘Jure' means ‘justly,'
‘rightlyss in the sense of ‘there was good
or sufficient cause.5 ‘J ure,' in its largest
sense, is right (τὸ δίκαιον); and in its limited
sense of ‘ law,’ that is, positive institution,
it is implied that positive law is conform-
able to a higher standard.

‘ Auctoritas ' and ‘ majestas ' are two un-
translateable words, which are generally
disposed of in a. summai-y, and a slovenly
way. They must both bc explained by refer-
ence to the political notions of the Romans.
The ‘auctoritas' of a thing or 3 person, is
the weight that is attached to the idea or
constitutiones the thing, or to the cha-
racter or office of the person. ‘ Mnjestasss
literally, the magnitude of a thing, -is its
