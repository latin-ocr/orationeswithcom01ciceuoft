aperte. Si te mecum dicendo ac diluendis criminibus in hac causa
contendere putarem, ego quoque in accusando atque in explicandis
criminibus operam consumerem 3 nunc quoniam pugnare contra me
instituisti, non tam ex tua natura quam ex istius tempore et causa,
malitiose, necesse est istiusmodi rationi aliquo consilio obsistere.
Tua ratio est ut seeundum binos ludos mihi respondere incipias;
mea ut ante primos ludos comperendinem. Ita fiet ut tua ista
ratio existimetur astuta, meum hoc consilium necessarium. ¹

XII. Verum illud quod institueram dicere, mihi rem tecum esse,
hujusmodi est. Ego quum hanc causam Siculorum rogatu rece-
pissem, idque mihi amplum et praeclarum existimassem, eos velle
meae fidei diligentiaeque periculum facere qui innocentiae absti-
nentiaeque fecissent3 tum suscepto negotio majus mihi quiddam
proposui, in quo meam in rem publicam voluntatem populus Roma-
nus perspicere posset. Nam illud mihi nequaquam dignum industria
conatuque meo Videbatur, istum a me in judicium jam omnium
judicio condemnatum vocari, nisi ista tua intolerabilis potentia et
ea cupiditas, qua per hosce annos in quibusdam judiciis usus es,

ten evidence of private persons and public
bodies. The word ‘ auctoritas ' must be
explained by reference to its general sense
of that which gives credibility to a thing,
or conflrms a thing or gives it the com-
plcteness which is required for any pur-
poses. Thus, the ‘auctoritas ³ of a tutor,
that is, his sanction, his appmbation, gives
to the act of the ‘ pupillus,' which without
it would be insufficient, its full legal effect.
Cicero accordingly seems to mean by ‘ auc-
toritatibusque ³ every kind of confirmatory
testimony which does not exactly come
within the meaning of the terms which he
lias already used. See c. 3.

instituisli‚] See Divin. c. 21, notc.—-
‘ex istius tempore:5 see Divin. c. 2, note.

malitiosa] Klotz has a uscful note on
the technical sense of ‘malitia' (Pro Cae-
cina, c. 1). Its literal signification of ‘bad-
ness' does not express its meaning herc.
It is that badncss in the purpose which
consists in 3 111311 availing himselfof alegal
right, or of legal forms, in a manner which
morality condemns ; for nothing is clcarcr
than that a man may make an immoral
use of a legal right. Klotz refers to the
following passages, which will assist the
reader in ascertaining the notion of ‘mali-
tia z' Tuscul. Disput. iv. 15, “nam malitia
certe cujusdam‚” &c.3 and De Off. iii. 17,
“ eaque malitia quae vult illa quidem videri
se esse prudentiam, sed abest ab ca distat-
que plurimmn.'’ The character of the

word is shown by the company which it
keeps ,- its companions are ‘ calliditaS,
fraus, et calumnia? Cicero (De Nat. Deo-
rum, iii. 30) calls the ‘judicium de dolo
malo,’ which C. Aquilius introduced, the
broom or besom (everriculum) for sweeping
away all ‘malitiae' Ulpian, Ad Edictum
(Dig. 4. 3. 1), uses ‘malitia' in this tech-
nieal sense ε “ 1100 edicto Praetor adversus
varios et dolosos qui aliis obfuerunt calli-
ditate quadam subvenit, ne vel illis malitia
sua sit lucrosa vel istis simplicitas (13111-
nosa.''

binos ludos] See Introd.

eomperendinem.] ‘ Comperendinare ' is
to put off a thing to the third day (peren-
die); and, according to Festus, “res com-
perendinata significat judicium in tertium
diem constitutum? Cicero says that his
adversary's design was to defer his answcr
until after the two first ‘ ludi' were over 3
while his own plan was to have his own
speech, and his adversary’s too, over before
the commencement of the first ‘ludi‚' and
so to come to the ‘ comperendinatio) What
this means is explained in a note to Act. ii.
Lib. 1. c. 9.

12. hujusmodi] ‘of this kind ’ or
‘ fashion! The Romans use this word as
if it were an adjective undcclined. So
they used ‘hujuscemodi‚' ‘ejusmodij ‘is-
tiusumdi?

cupidam] ‘ corruptionem judicum sig-
nificat.’ (Aseon.)
