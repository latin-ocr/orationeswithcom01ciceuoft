ffla defensorem sui juris, ultorem injuriarum, actorem causae totius

adoptavit.

XVII. At eam tibi C. Verres fecit injuriam quae ceterorum

quoque animos posset alieno incommodo commovere.

Minime :

nam id quoque ad rem pertinere arbitror, qualis injuria dicatur,

quae causa inimicitiarum proferatur.

Cognoscite ex 111ος nam

iste eam profecto, nisi plane nihil sapit, nunquam proferet. Agonis
est quaedam Lilybaetana, liberta Veneris Erycinae3 quae mulier

ante hunc quaestorem copiosa plane et locuples fuit.

adoptavit] ‘has selected by its own
choice.' See ‘ optionem’ c. 14. We have
adopted the word in nearly the same sense.
The Romans also used ‘adoptare' to ex-
press the adoption of a child (Gaius, i.

17. liberta Veneris] Agonis had been
a slave attached to the temple of Venus at
Mount Er3x, in Sicily (Act. ii. Lib. 2. c.
8), · 5110 had been 0110 of the 011155 whom
the Greeks called ἱερόδουλοι, of which
Strabo speaks (p. 272, ed. Casaub.). See
Polybius (i. 55). Slaves were possessed
both by individuals, and by the state, and
other bodies, as municipal towns and tem-
ples. Klotz refers to Cicero, Pro Cluentio,
c. 15, for similar instances. This woman
had been manumitted, and had herself be-
come a slave-holder 3 and, to save her pro-
perty, she pretended that she and all that
she had belonged to the goddess, that is,
were dedicated to the serw'ce of religion,
and so were of the class of sacred things.
Strabo's account of the great temple at
Comana (ed. Casaub. 535, 536, 558) is in-
structive. The priest occupied a good 111000
of land, which was attached to the temple,

of Strabo's xis-it, this opulent 111105 st had
six thousand slaves, men and wmuen, all
working for him. The people all about
the temple were the subjects of the king,
but also owed obedicnce in sacred matters,
we may suppose, to the priest. VVheu Cn.

Temple of Venus at Corinth possessed above
a thousand female 513105, courtezans, whom
both men and women dedicated to the god-
dess 3 “and it was by reason of them‚”
adds the grave philosopher, with the ut-
most simplieity (p. 378), “that the city
was much frequented and enriched, for the
seafaring folks readily eased themselves of
their money.'' We 1113)· now understand
what the temple at Eryx was, and the

‘Venerei,' or slaves of Venus. There was
probably a coUege of Venerei at Pompeii,
as we infer from the following words
found in an inscription on abuilding there :
