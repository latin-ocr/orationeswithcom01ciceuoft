82 IN O. VERREM

mentis atque oratione firmavero, tum testes ad crimen accommodem ;
ut nihil inter illam usitatam accusationem atque hanc novam inter-
sit, nisi quod in illa tunc quum omnia dicta sunt testes dantur,
hic in singulas res dabuntur3 ut illis quoque eadem interro-
gandi facultas, argumentandi dicendique sit. Si quis erit qui
perpetuam orationem accusationemque desideret, altera actione
audiet: nunc id quod facimus, ea ratione facimus ut malitiae
illorum consilio nostro occurramus, necessario fieri intelligat. Haec
primae actionis erit accusatio. Dicimus C. Verrem, quum multa
libidinose, multa crudeliter in cives Romanos atque socios, multa
in deos hominesque nefarie fecerit, tum praeterea quadringenties
sestertium ex Sicilia contra leges abstulisse. Hoc testibus, hoc
tabulis privatis publicisque auctoritatibus ita vobis planum facie-
mus, ut hoc statuatis, etiamsi spatium ad dicendum nostro com-

modo vacuosque dies habuissemus, tamen oratione longa nihil opus
fuisse. Dixi.

passage3 and the interpretation is con-

Klotz thinks that he
sistent with the facts, for in this trial

does the best service to this passage by

‘ ea enim ratione?

Verres was prosecuted for Repetundae, and
not for other offences3 though Cicero, in
order to aggravate the odium against him,
exposed all his public life, and even that
part of it which had no relation at all to
the conduct of Verres in Sicily or to the
particular charge, which was a demand of
so much money against him as illegally
gotten 111 Sicily. In another passage (Act.
ii. Lib. 1. c. 11), 110 reminds his (supposed)
hearers of the way in which he had pro-
ceeded in the ‘prior actio :³ “ Etenim sic
me ipsum egisse memoria tenetis, ut in
testibus interrogandis onmia crimina pro-
ponerem et explicarem, ut quum rem totam
in medio posuissem tum denique testem
interrogarem-'³ Hc also (Act. ii. Lib. 3. c.
44) sayS‚ “ De Aetnensibus perpauca dicam 3
dixerunt 0111111 ipsi priore actione publice‚’'
which means that the men sent by the
Aetnenses had been examined, and had
given their evidence on behalf of their
town (publice). Zumpt maintains the cor-
rectness of this passage against Hotmann
and those who have. followed him. But his
explanation is not quite the same as mine.
Madvig omits ‘ interrogando?

illam usitatam . . testes dantum] Com-
pare the passage in the Pro Flacco, c. 10,
‘ Nam antea,' &c.‚ vol. iii. and the note.

mmo id quodfaez'mus,] Asconius found
this passage as obscure as ‘ illa in fine ora-
tionis pro Ligario 3' and he adds ‘ nisi forte
facimus· semel ponitur? Camerarius reads

pointing it thus ε “ nunc id, quod facimus,
ea ratione facimus, ut malitiae illorum con-
silio nostro occurramus : necessario fieri
intelligat.” Hc explains the ‘ asyndeton,’
‘necessario . . intelligat? by supposing that
the ‘ut' extends its force to it, so that
‘intelligat ³ depends upon ‘ut ³ as well as
‘occurramus ² does. Ι have no hesitation
111 rejecting this explanation. It is plain
that ‘ necessario fieri intelligat ⁹ is con-
nected with ‘nunc id quod facimus ;’ and
if the intermediate words are omitted, the
sense is ‘now let him understand that what
we are doing is done of necessity? Now
there 15 110 great difficulty in understand-
ing the words ‘ ea ratione . . occurramuS,'
as being interposed as a rapidly delivered
parenthesis between the two extremes, the
connexion of which seems to me very clear.
Zumpt points it thus : “ nunc id, quod
facimus (ea ratione facimus, ut malitiae
illorum consilio nostro occurramus) neces-
sario fieri intelligat‚'' and Iordan does the
same, but he has adopted ‘intelliget,' an
unnecessary alteration by Fritzsche.
Dima] It was the practice, says Asco-
nius, of the ancient orators to say ‘Dixi '
when they had done speaking ; and for the
praetor to pronounce the word ‘ dixerunt '
when both parties had fini shed. Perhaps As-
conius meant to say ‘ praeco ' for ‘ practor,'
as hc ought to have done (Act. ii. Lib. 2.
0. 30); and it is printed ‘praeco' in the
corrected text of Asconius (ed. Orelli).
