AOT. Π. LIBER PRIMUS.

aliud in tabulis habebas. Hinc illae extraordinariae pecuniae, quas
nullo duce tamen aliqua ex particula investigamuS, redundarunt:
¹ hinc ratio cum Q. et Cn. Postumis Curtiis multis nominibus quo-
rum in tabulis iste habet nullum : hinc HS quaterdecies P. Tadio
numeratum Athenis testibus planum faciam ; hinc empta apertis-
sime praetura ; nisi forte id etiam dubium est quomodo iste praetor
factus sit. Homo scilicet aut industria aut opera probata aut
frugalitatis existimatione praeclara, aut denique, id quod levissimum
est, assiduitate, qui ante quaesturam cum meretricibus lenonibusque
vixisset, quaesturam ita gessisset quemadmodum cognovistis, Romae
post quaesturam illam nefariam vix triduum constitisset, absens
non in oblivione jacuisset, sed in assidua commemoratione omnibus
omnium flagitiorum fuisset, is repente, ut Romam venit, gratis
praetor factus est. Alia porro pecunia ne accusaretur data. Cui
sit data, nihil ad me, nihil ad rem pertinere arbitror: datam quidem
esse tum inter omnes recenti negotio facile constabat. Homo stul-
tissime et amentissime, tabulas quum conficeres, et quum extraor-
dinariae pecuniae crimen subterfugere velles, satis te elapsurum
omni suspicione arbitrabare, si quibus pecuniam credebas iis expen-
sum non ferres neque in tuas tabulas ullum nomen referres, quum
tot tibi nominibus acceptum Curtii referrent? Quid proderat tibi
te expensum illis non tulisse? An tuis solis tabulis te causam
dicturum existimasti?

XL. Verum ad illam jam veniamus praeclaram praeturam, cri-

nesti would alter ‘ quod ' to ‘id ;' and
other alterations have been proposed, all
of which are unnecessary. The text is as
plain as it can he z ‘ the which you, most
immaculate of men, had entered quite dif-
ferently in your hooks.’

eoetraorclinariae] Any money not ac-
quired in the usual way might be called
‘extraordinaria ;' but prohahly this term
had a technical meaning. That the money
was in this case dishoncstly acquired ap-
peared from the amount, and from the fact
of Verres keeping no account of these large
sunm, which he paid over to others to keep
for him, and to avoid detection. The ‘ ex-
traordinaria pecunia,' according to Sa.-
vigny, consists in thc omission ot' an entry
which ought to hc made, which entry was
omitted for the. purpose of fraud and con-
cealment (Pro Rosc. Com. c. 1).

numeratum] The old reading ‘nume-
rata‚' though the reading of all the MSS„

as it is said, is not the true reading; for
J. F. Gronovius has shown that Hs, with
a numeral adverb, must be taken as a
neuter singular (Zumpt). See Zumpt's
Appendix, aud ‘in ducentis et triciens
sestertio: Pro Fonteio, iii. 4, ed. Nieh.

assiduitaie,] This is a term applied to
candidates for offices, who showed them-
selves to the people, and canvassed for
votes· Klotz refers to the oration Pro
Cn. Plancio, c. 26, and Pro L. Murena,
c. 9.

erpensum . . acceptum] Verres made
no entries of what he had lent, but the
Curtii had made entries of what they had
received from him. Cicero says that
Verres could not escape by having kept no
account of this transm-tion. for others had
kept accounts, aud their accounts would
be produced. The books of Verres and
of the Curtii ought to have agreed, it· all
the transactione were honest.
