Ι. REPETUNDAE.

ΤΗΕ Crimen Repetundarum Pecuniarum in Cicero’s time comprehended,
among other things, the offence committed by a Roman provincial gover-
nor in getting money or other valuable things by illegal means from the
subjects and Socii of Rome. The direct object of the prosecuit-ion to
which such a governor was liable, was the recovery of the money which
he had taken3 and hence the term Repetundae (res repetere). But the
word ‘ Repetundae ’ is also used to express the illegal act for which com-
pensation was sought. In the earlier periods of the Roman State the
legal offence of Repetundae did not exist, for the Roman magistrates
were seldom long absent from Rome3 and when they did leave Rome for
a time, it was only to carry on war against their near neighbours. It
was during the second Punic war that the first instanees occur of com-
plaints made against the behaviour of Roman commanders in distant
parts. An instance of this is mentioned by Livy (xxix. 8-16, Sec.)
when the Locri of Italy complained to the Roman Scnate of the mis-
conduct of the legatus Q. Pleminius. The senate sent commissioners to
inquire into the affair on the spot, and they brought Pleminius, and
others who were as guilty as himself, in chains to Rome. Pleminius
died in prison before the Populus had pronounced judgment (prius—
quam judicium de eo populi perficeretur). The Lex Porcia, probably
proposed by M. Porcius Cato about Rc. 198, was the first legislative
act on the abuse of their power by provincial governors. The terms of
this Lex are supposed to be referred to by Livy (xxxii. 27) ; but this is
hardly a correct interpretation of the passage. There was, however, a
Lex Porcia, which is cited in the Plebiscitum dc Thermensibus ¹, which
limited the amount of what governors could demand of the provincials ε
and it is possible that the prohibition mentioned by Cicero (Vcrr. Act.
ii. Lib. 4. c. 5) may have been contained in the Lex Porcia3 or, as some
