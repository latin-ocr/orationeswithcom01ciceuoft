92 IN O. VERREM

illum ejus peculatum vel acerrime vindicandum putent, quod iste
M. Marcelli et P. Africani monumenta, quae nomine illorum, re
vera populi Romani et erant et habebantur, ex fanis religiosissimis
ct ex urbibus sociorum atque amicorum non dubitaverit auferre.

V. Emerserit ex peculatus etiam judicio, meditetur de ducibus
hostium quos accepta pecunia liberavit; videat quid de illis respon-
deat quos in eorum locum subditos domi suae reservavit3 quaerat
non solum quemadmodum nostro crimini, verum etiam quo pacto
suae confessioni possit mederi ; meminerit se priore actione, clamore
populi Romani infesto atque inimico excitatum, confessum esse duces
praedonum a se securi non esse percussos, se jam tum esse veritum
ne sibi crimini daretur eos ab se pecunia liberatos; fateatur id quod
negari non potest, se privatum hominem praedonum‘Huees vivos
atque incolumes domi suae, posteaquam Romam redierit, usquedum
per me licuerit, tenuisse. Hoc in illo majestatis judicio si licuisse
sibi ostenderit, ego oportuisse concedam. Ex hoc quoque evaserit,
proficiscar eo quo me jampridem vocat populus Romanus. De jure

dabitur a me argentum dum erit commo-
dun1.” Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 26, ‘ quos ei
commodum sit invitet 3' and c. 44.

M. Illarcelli csta] The works of art
which M. Marcellus gave up to the Siculi,
and those which Scipio Africanus brought
back from Carthage, and restored to them.

5. Emerserit] This tense is often so
placed. ‘ Suppose him to escape from the
prosecution for Pcculatus ς’ which might be
considered to be an elliptical expression,
some word being understood. Compare ⁵ ex
hoc evaserit ' in this chapter τ and c. 14, ‘fu-
erit aliis.⁵ See Heindorf, Horat. 1 Sat. i.
45, note. But the present indicative, and
even the perfect, are used to express a
condition without ‘ si 3³ and ‘ emerserit’
may be the second future of the indica-
tive.

per me limma] ‘ So long as Ι allowed
it ;' that is, ‘I was the hindrance to its
being done any longer? ‘ Per me licet ς’
‘ You may do it for me, Ι won't hinder you.’
‘ Habeat per me,' c. 12.

majestatis judicio] The acts just nlen-
tioned would be sufficient to found a prose·
cution for ‘ Majestas ' against Verres, who
had saved the enemies of the state. The
‘ Majestas ³ of the Roman state is its ‘ in-
tegrity ;' and the ‘ Majestas Populi Ro-
mani' is the whole of that which consti-
tuted the Roman state. To impair (minu-
ere) this ‘ Majestas ³ was an offence 3 and it
might be impaircd by any act which directly
tendcd to damasso the state, as such. The

old name for any act which was directly
injurious to the state was ‘ Perduellio‚' and
the offender was called ‘ Perduellis.' Trials
for ‘ Perduellio ² took place even 111 the later
times of the Republic, as 111 the case of C.
Popilius Laenas, B.C. 107, and of M. J unius
Silanus, consul B.C. 109. By the words
‘apud Populum Ronmnmn,’ which follow
111 this chapter, Cicero threatens Verres
with a. prosecution before the Roman peo-
ple, for putting to death a Roman citizen;
and here the guilt of Verres would be de-
cided by the ‘ suffragia Populi Romani?
Cicero promises to bring him before the
‘ Populus Romanus,' in his capacity of
aedile, when he should have entered on
his office ; and the charge would be that of
‘ Perduellio.’—Cicero here speaks of a ‘ Ma-
jestatis judicium ' as a distinct thing from
‘ Perduellio 3' at least, distinct in the form
of procedure. Though the notion of ‘ Ma-
j estas minuta ’ was involved in that of ‘ Per-
duellio,' special ‘leges’ had defined ‘Ma-
jestas' more particularly, and made it a
Quaestio. The first was a Lex Apuleia
(B.C. 102 or 100), which was followed by a
Lex Cornelia, and this by a Lex J ulia,
which Lex J ulia continued to be the fun-
damental Lex on this subject under the
empire (Dig. 48. tit. 4).—Tl1e subject of
‘ Perduellio' and ‘ Majestas ' is discussed
with great minuteness by Rein, Das Cri-
minalrecht der Romer.
