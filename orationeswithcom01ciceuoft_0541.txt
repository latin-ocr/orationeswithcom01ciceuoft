Europam in tauro] After which the

codd. dett. and 010111 add the idle word

‘Rsedentem The old stories of the Greeks
and their art were inseparable. The real
elements of art existed in the minds of the
people, and the artist had only to embody
them. It is different with us, among
whom the idea does not exist, and 001150-
quently either cannot be embodied, or if a
man arises who has the idea and the power
to give it form, there are few who under-
stand what hc has done. He has given
a form to 311 1(103 which does not exist 111
the mind of the people.

A modern artist has placed a naked
Ariadne on a lcopard's back, which people
admire, or affect to admire, though it is,
to most who see it, a naked woman in
marble seated on a beast, and no more.
If we admit the mechanical skin of the
sculptor, we must still condemn his taste.
Ovid has the story of Europa (Met. ii.

“ Induitur tauri faciem.”

Ovid has materials for an artist who ean
use them. There is a large folio Dutch
translation of the Metamorphoses, 11)· Von-
del, ‘with beautiful copper-plates' (Am-
sterdam, 1703). Some of them are not
bad. They show what a man of genius
might do, if 110 took Ovid for his master.

lf we may put a woman 0113 beust, it
should be 311 animal 011 which she can sit,
and a bull’s back will answcr the purpose..
It will also be consistent with the heavy
nature of this heast that he should be at
rest, or have vcry little action. lfa Greek
placed 3 woman on a leopard or such au
animal, 110 would makelhc. 110351 in motion,
and he would not make the woman naked.
In a beautiful coin of Sybrita iu Crete
we 500 3 woman scated on the back of a
sculptor' 5 le‹›p.·ud. 8110 has one hand on
the animal's neck aud in the other a thyr-
sus. She sits upright hare to the waist;
the drapery is well fixed about her hips
and hang-s down leaving her feet free.
‘l‘he beust is gallopiug at a great rate, but
the woman will not come oll'. She sits
firm.

Satyrum] Satyrus, says Zumpt, was the
native deity of the Tarentini. Hence Sa-

turum Tarentum (Virg. Georg. ii. 197) is
explained, though Servius supposes a town,
Saturum or Satureium, near Tarentum 3
and also Steph. Byzant. v. Σατύρων.
Heindorf also adopts this explanation os

the ggholiast 011 the 11110 of Horace, 1 Sat.
vl. :

“ Me Satureiano vectari rura caballo.''

Cupidinis sz'fflzum propter 2512] The
words ‘propter . . . Thespiae' are out of
place here. 800 0. 2.

Cnidios‚] See c. 2, note on Praxiteles,
and add to the references Lucian, Imag.

Coos ?] The people of Cos had also 3
Venus of Praxiteles, 3 draped statue, in-
ferior to the naked figure of the Cnidii.
(Plin. H. N. 34, 8; 36, 5, ed. Hard.)
But the pride of Cos was the Aphrodite
Anadyomene of Apelles, in the temple of
Aesculapius, Venus rising from the waves,
and pressing from her hair the water which
dripped from her like a transparent vcil.
Ovid (Trist. ii. 527), who had seen the
picture and could paint much in few
words, has preserved the characteristics z

“ Sic madidos digitis siccat Venus uda
capillos,

Et modo maternis tecta videtur
aquis.”

Τ110 model of the Anadymncnc was the
beautiful Campaspe or l’ancaste, the fa-
vorite mistress 01“ Alexander, who ordered
Apelles to paint her 11·11(0(1. Τ110 painter
