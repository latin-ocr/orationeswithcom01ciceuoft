J UDICIA. 49

an appeal (provocatio) to the popular assembly (comitia centuriata).
Thus the supreme jurisdiction in criminal matters was secured to the
people. Afterwards the Tributa Comitia in some way got the power of
judging high offences against the State. The distinction between Public
crimes (publica crimina) and Private injuries (privata delicta) corre-
sponds to the distinction in the mode of procedure. The State as
such, that is the people in their ‘comitia,’ judged all such offences
as were directly opposed to the interests of the State. The Publica
Crimina ultimately comprehended numerous offences, the complete list
of which belongs to a later period than that which we are consider-
ing (Dig. 48. tit. 1). Among them were Perduellio or treason (in a
sense), murder and Parricidium, Repetundae, Ambitus, and many others.
‘Delicta’ were the subjects of actions, and belonged to the compe-
tence of the Ordo Judiciorum Privatoruni. ‘Delicta’ comprehended
‘furtum,' ‘rapina,’ ‘injuria,’ and ‘damnum injuria' (Gaius, iii. 1823
Justin. Inst. iv. 1).

The administration of criminal justice was thus in the hands of the
people and exercised in the Comitia. The offences which were cog-
nizable, were chiefly deterlnined and defined by custom. As to the
Leges which preceded the Twelve Tables we know little, and the Twelve
Tables themselves, if they were sufficient for the time, soon required to
have their deficiencies supplied. They did not comprise every offence
which the moral and religious notions of the people considered as worthy
of punishment; and this defect was not made up by direct legislation.
The power of the people, who were the judges in their Comitia, was not
limited as that of the J udices in the time of Cicero by particular Leges.
The Magistratus, who prosecuted before the Comitia, prepared a bill of
indictment, in which the offence and the penalty were ccinprised; and
the judges, that is, the people, might accept or reject his Rogatio. The
offence might be one which opinion considered deserving of punishment,
according to a just interpretation or extension of the provisions of the
Twelve Tables, or it might be something new, which opinion declared to
be deserving of punishment. Such instances of punishment served as
precedents, both as to the crime and the punishment. This develop-
ment of the criminal law is precisely what might be expected in a. State,
where the assembled people gave judgment, 'and when legislation was
still very imperfect. A code which minutely defines crimes and fixos
punishments never can exist in the early period of a nation's history.
The trials before thc Comitia would gradually lead to the establishnient
of forms of procedure and the more exact definition of crinics; and
though the carly criminal law of Rome had no systeniatic character, it
does not follow that it was not practically good for the time.
