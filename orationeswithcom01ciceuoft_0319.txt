6. vectigalium] ‘Vectigal' contains
the root ‘ vec,' the same as ‘ veh,' in ¹ veh-
ereg' but the reason of ‘vectigal’ signi-
fying a tax is not clear. So long as Rome
had a small territory, there was little pub-
lic property from which the State could
derive a revenue. If any tax was derived
in such way, it may have been called Vec-
tigal, as it is asserted (Becker, Hand-
buch, (Kc, iii. 2. 122). When Rome began
to acquire territory in Italy, the revenue
from the public lands would increase.
‘ Tributum' is the tax which from the
time of Servius Tullius was paid by the
Roman citizens. It was a sum paid in
respect of the estimated value of a man’s
property 3 and, inasmuch as property in
land was the chief property, it was in sub-
stance a land-tax, paid under the for-m of
a general tax on property. Whatever may
be the reason of the name, it is certain
that from the time of Servius Tullius, it
was a tax which was founded on the ‘ cen-
sus ’ or rating of the Roman citizens. It
was a property-tax, and it varied accord-
ing to the necessities of the State, or rather
according to the expenditure, like our
income-tax. 'Rhis is not the place to
examine the matter fully. The render
may refer to Becker, as above, where he
will find the passages cited, and 501110.
things said which he will not believe, if
he uses his own judgmcnt.

When the trcasury was euriehed hy
the Macedonian war, the ‘tributum '
was abolished, 13.C. 167, and it was
never afterwards permanently restored in
Italy. From this time the chief income of
the Roman State consisted ot' the taxes
raised 111 the provinces, particularly of the
produce of the earth, as teuths or tithes.
This produce and other taxes were in-

‘videbuntur ' Lg. 42 p. m.

cluded under the term ‘ vectigal,' in which
Cicero, De Imp. Cn. Pomp. 0. 6, includes
‘portoria' and ‘scriptura.’ In the Lex
Thoria, cap. 10, we find “ neive quid quoi
ob eam rem vectigal neive scripturam dare
debeto,” where both ‘ vectigal ' and ‘ scrip-
tura' are used, according to the legal
superfluity of expression, the object being
to exclude any possible payinent for the
pasturage of cattle, the matter of which
this clause in the Lex treats. ‘ Vectigal,’
then, which had a limited meaning, be-
came a general term for a tax, as this
passage proves, for Cicero speaks of ‘ vec-
tigal certum quod stipendiarium dicitur,'
by which he means a fixed money pay-
ment or land-tax, which money payment
is contrasted with the ‘censoria locatio‚'
or the tenths which were let by the consors
at Rome, and pursuant to a Lex Sempro-
nia, probably the Agraria Lex of C. Sem-
pronius Gracchus. Under thc empire, all
the provincial payments were ultimately
reduced to a tixed sum of money, the
progr-ess towards which we see in the time
of Gaius, hy his application of the terms
‘stipendiaria’ and ‘ tributoria ' (ii. 21) to
lands in the provinces.

The following passage will serve as a.
commentary on this chapter: “All the pro-
vinces except Sicily? says Cicero (Verr.
Lib. 3. c. 6), “pay either a tixed land-tax
vectigal stipendiarium) or ναι-1111110 duties

Sicily, on the other hand, has the follow-
ing constitution : two foederate cities and ·
five others are tax-free ς a few which have
come under the Roman dominion hy con-

other provinces) 3 all the rest of the land
