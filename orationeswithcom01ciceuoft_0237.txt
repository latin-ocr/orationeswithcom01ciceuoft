convenirent, electi qui Verri viderentur.

himself and the ‘palaestritae‚' that is, the
city of Syracuse. He demanded that the
‘judices ³ should be appointed according to
the Lex Rupilia. His opponents demanded
that they should be appointed in another
way. Verres declared that he would not
follow the Lex Rupilia (c. 16) ; and he ap-
pointed five ‘judices ³ according to his own
pleasure, as Cicero says. For the purpose
of understanding the text, it is enough
to see that Cicero affirms that Heraclius
claimed the appointment of ‘judices' ac-
cording to the Lex Rupilia, and that a
selection ‘ ex iis civitatibus . . . quae,' δια,
was not conformable to the Lex Rupilia.
Cicero says that the claim against Heraclius
was by the ‘ palaestritae‚’ and that was the
same thing as a claim by the city of Syra-
cuse. The ‘judiees' then in this case should
have been appointed according to the terms
mentioned in c. 13, “quod privatus a po-
pulo petit—solent.” In the note on that
chapter I have supposed that the rule
‘ quod privatus a populo petit ' did not
apply when a ‘ eivitas’ had a claim against
one of its own citizens ς and Heraclius was
a Syracusan. But it is innnaterial whether
that explanation is correct or not. Cicero
founds his statement on the fact of the
claim being made by the ‘ civitas ³ of Syra-
cuse against a citizen of Syracuse. The
citizen appealed to the Lex Rupilia, rightly
or wrongly, I know not. Verres appointed
five ‘judices' at his pleasure. This is all
clear3 and the real truth of the matter,
which we perhaps cannot reach, is perfectly
iunnaterial for the understanding of the
passage. Zumpt has a note on the merits
of the case, and a very bad one. Heraclius
claimed the appointment of ‘judices' ac-
cording to the Lex Rupilia 5 and, if 1
understand Cicero right, these would be
‘ selecti judices ex civium Romanormn con-
ventu.' Thc ‘adversarii' contcnded that
they should be ehosen ‘ex iis civitatibus
quae in id forum convenirent‚' that is, from
the ‘ conventus Syra‹·usanus,' bnt not from
Roman citizens, But here 01111105 a diffi-
culty which Madvig bas notit-cd. Tho
common text is ‘ quae in id sorum conveni-
rent. Electi qui Verri vidcrentur.' Tho
sentence beginning ‘ adversarii postulant,'
expresses the claim of one party. ‘ 110111,-
011115 contra’ expresses the claim of 110111-
clius. 1f we intel-pose something about
those who were finally chosen, it is obviously
out of place. Resides that, the fact os tho

Heraclius contra ut ju-

selection of the ‘judices' is mentioned in
its proper place at the end of the next
chapter. Madvig also says, that if the sen-
tence ‘eleeti,' 810. expresses the fact of
selection, it should be ‘videbanturf and
not ‘ viderentur? Accordingly he removes
the ‘interpunctio major' before ‘electi,' and
the sentence will stand as it does in the
text 3 and the word ‘electi' nmst be referred
to ‘judices dentur.' This is a simple re-
medy, and the only remedy, unless we ex-
punge the words ‘electi . . . viderentur?
The following explanation of this pas-
sage has been suggested to ine—When
the day came which Verres had fixed for
holding the courts at Syracuse, he intended
to name ‘judiees' for the case of Hera-
clius. But Heraclius made an objection
about the thirty days, the objection was
allowed, and Heraclius supposed that his
case would stand over to the next ‘ sortitio.³
In the mean time Verres' successor might
arrive. It may be supposed that six months
might elapse between the praetor's visits
for the purpose of holding the courts. But
Verres outwitted Heraclius by deferring
all the cases, until that of Heraclius could
legally be included. then the day 0111111),
Heraclius claimed that the trial should
proceed ‘aequo jure‚' that is (c. 13) 115
‘civis cum civi, 'for the 1¹ 1111105 t11t 11 west
equivalent to the Populus Syr 110511 1151111,
and the suit could fairly be tried· 51115
le< ibus.' This 11111111111111115155111111 that
‘privatus a populo’ (c. 13) applies only to
a suit between an individual and another
state, in which case there would be no
common forms of law between them. and
therefore the praetor must assign ‘judices'
from a third conununity. The opponentn-
of Heraclius seem to have urged that the
‘palm-stritae' represented others besides
the. Populus Syracusanus, inasmuch as
other states frequented the public place of
Syracuse, and that therefore Verres ought
to treat this ns a case in which a ‘pri-
vatus' stood opposed to other states, and
ought to appoint ‘judices ¹ from such

states ‘quae in id forum convenirent.y

School.)

There may bc objections to this ex-
planation, which 1 leave to others to dis-
cover. But 115 1 cannot suggest any other
explanation of the passage than that which
I originally gave, and as there is some
obscuri( y in Cicero, 1 think many readers
