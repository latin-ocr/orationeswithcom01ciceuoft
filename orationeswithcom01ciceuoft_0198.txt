180 EDICTA MAGISTRATUUM.

appropriated to legal business, and the ‘ dies nefasti‚' on which the courts
did not sit, there were some days on which a Magistratus might sit or
not, as he pleased. He could also say what persons he would allow to
apply to him, or what persons he would allow to act as attorneys for
others. This power was necessary in order to maintain the character of
the court. We have an example in the Edict (Ulpian, Lib. vi. Ad
Edictum, Dig. 3. tit. 1) of the class of persons who were not allowed to
apply to him-⁶³. In cases where sureties were required, the Magistratus
had to decide on their sufficiency3 and in the case of ‘ vindicationes,' or
actions in which the' ownership of property was in question, he had to
⁴ determine who should have possession provisionally, until the right of
ownership was ascertained. He could also require the person whom he
pronounced to be in possession to give security for the restoration of
the thing, with the intermediate profits (praedes litis et vindiciarum), if
it should be decided that the ownership belonged to the other party
(Graius, iv. 16). He had then to determine who must be plaintiff and who
must be defendant, for he who claims a thing ofwhich another is in posses-
sion must prove that he has a better title than the possessor. A Praetor,
however, would not give the possession arbitrarily3 he would declare that
the person actually in possession must be considered as the possessor, if
he had not obtained the possession illegally against the other party, as,
sor instance, by force3 and he would further declare that he would pro-
tect him in possession against all violence, until the right was decided.
If a person in possession claimed this protection against the attempt of
another to disturb his possession, the Magistratus could compe] the dis-
turber to make a Sponsio, as it was ter1ned3 that is, to acknowledge that
he was bound to pay a sum of money if he was guilty of an attempt to
disturb the possession. This being done, the possessor could sue upon
the Sponsio, and he would declare that the defendant who had entered
into the obligation of the Sponsio was indebted to him in the sum of
money named in it, inasmuch as the fact of disturbanee had taken place.
A Judex was then named by the Praetor, whose duty it was to inves-
tigate the facts, and, if he found that the disturbanee had taken place, he
condemned the defendant. (See Excursus V., Sponsiones.) In this way
the Magistratus established a new kind of right—the right of possession.
This right of possession originated in the general opinion that pos-
session, when not acquired illegally against the claimant of the owner-
ship, must be regarded as a right, and as a right opposed to the still
undetermined right of ownership, which might be eit-her in the possessor
or the claimant. Out of this notion of the right of possession grew the

dignitatis tuendae et decoris causa, ne sine dedecore passim apud se postuletur?
