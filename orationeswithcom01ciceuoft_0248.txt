procuratores postulant] The ‘ procura-
tores’ of Epicrates; those who represented
him and acted for him. See Divin. 0. 4.
They offered 10 give security that their
principal would comply with the terms of
the 1100151011 (judicatum solvi satisdaturos).

fraudandi causa] One of the cases in
which the practor’s edict permitted 1105505-
51011 10 110 taken of a person’s property
was that of his concealing himself, or keep-
ing out of the way, for the purpose of de-
frauding his creditors. Klotz refers to the
terms of the edict (Pro P. Quintio, c. 19),
“ Qui fraudationis eausa latitant ;'' and to
the Digest, 42. 4, “quibus ex causis in
possessionem eatur.” The creditors were
said ‘ in possessionem mitti? The case re-
sembles that of the English Bankrupt Law
of 6 Geo. IV. 0. 16, 5. 3, by which, ifa
trader “ shall depart from his dwelling—
house, or otherwise absent himself, or begin
to keep his house, &c., with intent to de-
feat or delay his creditors, he shall have
committed an act of bankruptcy.” When
the trader has been adjudged to be a bank-
rupt, the commissioners sign a warrant di-
rected 10 a person called a messenger, who
is empowered 10 501Ζο the bankrupt's pro-
perty for the benefit of his creditors.—
‘ possidere liceat' Orelli.

nullum wentini :] An instance of a
double negation which does not produce an
affirmative.. Klotz and Iordan omit ‘ nul-
lum‚’ and it is not in V. Keller retains
‘ nullum' (Sem. i. p. 121, note). If a
reader had heard nothing about two nega-
tives producing an affirmative,——an ex-
pression which is incapable of any exact
meaning,—l1e would find no difficulty here,
and he would translate it: ‘ Epicrates
owed not a sesterce to no 011103 Τ110 111-
stanees in which the Latin writers use
such a 1110110 of negation are not common 3
nor would they use it 10 a sentence like
this, if Cicero had said ‘ non debehat?
Other cases of a different kind of double
negation are not uncommon, as Zumpt
shows. After a general negation in the
principal sentence, there may be negation

of the several 1111115, as Cicero, Pro Murena, ”
0. 29, “viri non 0550 neque exorari neque
placari,’' where, in fact, the omission of
the ‘neque' would give quite a different
meaning ; also 0. 40, “ 51 nemini nec domi
nce militiae odio fuit.’' Zumpt quotes also
the following instances from these orations
of the use of ‘ne—quidem :² Lib. 1. 0. 60,
“non enim praetereundum est ne id qui-
dem 3⁹³ and Lib. 3. c. 90, “non fugio ne
hos quidem mores.” See also Lib. 4. 0. 1.

judicio se pasmzrosfl This is the read-
ing of all the MSS„ including V, except
that Lg. 42 p. m. has ‘in judicio? In
place of the MSS. reading ‘judicium 50
passuros,' ‘jndicio secum agi passuros'
have been substituted. Klotz refers to
Act. ii. Lib. 3. c. 28, where also he reads
‘judicio se passuros,' from Lg. 42 and V.
Klotz also refers to Pro P. Quintio, 0. 28.
Zumpt has it thus : ‘ si quis quid peteret in
judicio, 50 passuros?

In the Digest there is ‘judicium acci-
pere 2' “ Qui non cogitur defendere absen-
tem, tamen si judicatum solvi satisdedit
defendendi absentis gratia, cogendus procu-
rator judicium accipere, ne decipiatur is
qui satis accepit ’³ (Dig. 3. 3. 43). But
Cicero also has ‘judicium accipere ’ (Pro P.
Quintio, 0. 20, vol. ii.) 3 and in the Digest
(5. 1. 8) there 15 ‘judicium pati? Zumpt
seems to doubt if ‘ petere judicio ' can be
said, and with good reason. It is not a
Roman expression, simply because the ‘ pc-
11101· ’ did not make his claim ‘ in judicio,'
but ‘ in jure? The accepting of the ‘ judi-
cium ’ was the formal conclusion of the
‘ Litis contestatio: or ¹ the proceedings of
the litigant parties before the praetor,'
in which both parties, by their mutual
statements, determine the matter in dispute
in such way that it is ready to be carried
before the ‘ judex.' These proceedings are
the last act ‘in jure,’ that is to say, of the
preliminary proceedings before the praetor:
they are contemporaneous with the For-
mula which is given by the praetor and
presupposcs the naming of a ‘judex,’ for
his name is mentioned in the formula
(Savigny, System des Heut. Rom-Rechts,
vi. 9, Litis contestatio). I have allowed ⁴
