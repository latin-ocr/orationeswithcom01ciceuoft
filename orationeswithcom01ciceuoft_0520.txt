There 1s a paper in the Journal of the
Βο1* 31 Agricultura] Society of England,
1854, 111* M. Esprit F abre of Agde, in
which 110 reports his experiments on the
cultivation of the Aegilops 01* ata, the
grains of which even 111 its 11* ild state gave
rise to the 1* arietv called Triticoides. Pro-
fessor Duv al 111 3 note at the end of the
paper says: “The 110005 5311* inference is

umbilicus] So the Greeks used the 11* ord
ὀμφαλός, 311(1 applied it to Delphi, Eurip.
Med. 1*. 666 :

τί δ’ ὀμφαλὸν γῆς θεσπιῳδὸν ἐστάλης,-
iz‘s ignibus]
“ Alta jacet vasti super ora Typhoeos Aetne,
Cujus anhelatis ignibus ardet humus.

Illic accendit geminas pro lampade pinus:

Hinc Cereris sacris nunc quoque taeda
datur.”—Ovi‹1‚ Fasti, iv. 491.

quas sibi quum . . peragrasse] This pas-
sage may perhaps be compared with the
passage ‘ Siculos sane . . non venisse.³ (See
the note, Act. i. 0. 9.) It is an instance of the
use of ‘ qni . . quum,' which is very different
from the usage of our language. It differs
fr0n1 other passages 111 which ‘ qni . . quum '
occur, in this, that ‘ (licitur inflammasse' 15
connected with ‘ peragrasse,' and the usage
of the Latin language in this 0350 neither
requires nor admits the conjunction ‘ and'
between the two infinitive verbs. See
c. 58.

Henna] Cicero's descriptions of places
are generally very clear. He had an exact
eye. He marks the site of Henna in such
a way that it cannot be mistaken. (Comp.
Livy, 24. c. 37.) Strabo (vi. p. 272, ed.
Cas.) speaks of the flowers about Henna,
and the legend of the girl who was pluck-
ing them when she was carried off by

‘glooniy Dis) The place is described, and
the story is told by a great master in this
kind (Ovid, Met. 1*. 385, &e.) :

“ Haud procul Hennaeis loeus est a moe-
nibus altae,
Nomine Pergus, aquae—-
Silva coronat aquas, cingens latus omne,
suisque

Frondibus ut velo Phoebeos submovet
ictus.

Frigora dant rami, Tyrios humus humida
flores.

He has also the story in his Fasti (iv. 419,
ἀρ.) of the rape of Proserpine, told in a
way that a painter might picture, if he were
a master of his art, as the poet is. An
ancient artist 1135 represented the rape of
Proserpine. The god has his bride in the
chariot, 311(1 15 already at the entrance of
