audiendum videtur? Unus adhuc fuit post Romam conditam, dii
immortales faxint ne sit alter, cui res publiea totam se traderet
temporibus et malis coacta domesticis, L. Sulla. Hie tantum
potuit ut nemo illo invito nec bona nec patriam nec vitam retinere
posset z tantum animi habuit ad audaciam ut dicere in contione non
dubitaret, bona civium Romanorum quum venderet, se praedam
suam vendere. Ejus omnes res gestas non solum obtinemus,
verum etiam propter majorum incommodorum et calamitatum
metum publica auctoritate defendimus: unum 1100 aliquot senatus
consultis reprehensum, decretumque est ut quibus ille de capite
dempsisset hi pecunias in aerarium referrent. Statuit senatus hoc,
ne illi quidem esse licitum, cui concesserat omnia, a populo factarum
quaesitarumque rerum summas imminuere. Illum viris fortissimis
judicarunt patres conscripti remittere de summa non potuisse; te
mulieri deterrimae reete remisisse senatores judicabunt? Ille, de
quo legem populus Romanus jusserat ut ipsius voluntas ei posset

35. L. Sulla] The dictator, L. Corne-

lius Sulla, to whose yoke the Romans had
submitted in a manner that would appear

did not make the attempt (Sueton. Caesar,
c· {{)capite] Rightly explained by Zumpt

incredible, if it were not explained by the
fact which Cicero points at, that a country
which has long been distracted by civil
commotion readily yields to a bold usurper.
Zachariae has written a Life of Sulla, which
is the work now usually referred to ς but it
is not impartial, nor always discriminating.
Plutarch has drawn a picture of this sin-
gular compound of sensuality, cruelty‚ and
ability, in his Life of Sulla.

in contione] Klotz refers to Ciccm, De
Off. ii. 8: “Est enim ansus dicere hasta
posita quum bona infore venderet et bono-
rum virorum et locupletium et certe civium,
praedam se suam vendere.’' This insolcnt
tyrant treated the property of proscribed
Roman citizens as if it were booty taken
from an enemy.

obtinemus,] ‘ maintain all that he ‹lid,'
in order to maintain tranquillity ; for, aster
a violent revolution, it is 111151111- and impos-
sible, all at once at least, to restore a tin-mer
state of things. Klotz quotes Quintilian
(Inst. ix. 1. ξ 85), who refers to a lost
oration of Cicero, De Liberis Proscripto-
rum, in which the same opinion is ex-
presscd : “ sed ita legibus Sullae cohaerere
statum civitatis affirmat ut his solutis stare
ipse non possit.¹' After the assassination
of Caesar, the eonspirators thought of rc-
scinding his ‘ucta,' but through sear they

to refer to the purchasers of the property
of the proscribed, who, after agreeing to
pay for it, prevailed on Sulla to remit the
whole or part of the purchase-money. The
words ‘ apopulo fizctarumss ac„ mean that
the senate would not consent to diminish
the amount of the property which had
been got and acquired by the Roman
peoplc. The property of the proscribed
citizens was dcclared public, and accord-
ingly the ‘aerarium' was entitlcd to the
full value of it.-—‘ae1·arinm referrent :’
Zumpt 11115 ‘aerarium deferrent' in his
minor edition, and 50 it is in the. English
reprint; a singular inistake, but Zumpt
candidly acknowlcdgcs his error in his
larger edition. He took ‘deferrent' from
Lg. 42. 14. 48, ‘propter anctoritatem co-
dicis illius? ‘Referre in aerarimm' ‘rc-
ferre rationes,’ and the like, are the usual
expressions. ‘ Deferre’ 11115 a dill'erent
meaning. An instance of ‘ (1010110. ’ occurs
in Lib. 2. 0. 19, “ut quidquid caelati ar-
genti fuit inillis bonis nd istum (1010101111 ;''
and there arc various other examples of its
1150. 111 these orations.

Ieyem . ‚jus-verat] 'Phe usual formula:
‘ populns Romanus jubet,’ und ⁸ jubere le-
gem) Orelli 11115 retained the false reading
‘lege,' which might be sasely corrected,
even if au the MSS. had it.
