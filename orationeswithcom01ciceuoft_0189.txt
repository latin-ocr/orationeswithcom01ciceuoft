AOT. ΙΙ. LIBER PRIMUS.

171

suorum quoque judicum fore putavit per sodalem suum, Q. Cur-
⁴ tium, judicem quaestionis [suae] ; cui ego nisi vi populi et hominum
clamore atque convicio restitissem, ex hac decuria vestra, cujus
mihi copiam quam largissimam factam oportebat, [erepta esset
facultas eorum] quos iste annuerat, in suum eonsilium sine causa

subsortiebatur.

praetor. Accordingly ‘judices quaestionum '
were appointed for certain ‘quaestione-s?
It does not appear how they were ap-
pointed, though it is probablc that it was⁴
by the votes of the people. Vv'lien C. Julius
‘Caefnr or Augu-:tus increased the number
of the praemis, the ‘judices quaestionum '
would not be wanted5 and this seems to
explain, as Madvig says, wli)⁷ we find no
mention of them except within that period

when they were required on account of the
deficient number of praetors.

The words ‘desunt multa' are sometimes
printed at the end of this oration. But
V. affirms that it is complete by the
words ‘in C. Verrem explicit feliciter ,·' and
Lg. 29 lia-2 ‘M. Tullii Ciceronis in C.
Verrem liber tertius explicit?
doubt if this oration is complete.
