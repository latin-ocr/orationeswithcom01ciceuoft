66 IN O. VERREM

[tamen] tanto opere quid in hac sorte metuendum mihi esset intel-
ligebam. Unum illud ex hominibus certis, ex quibus omnia com-
peri, reperiebam : fiscos complures cum pecunia Siciliensi a quodam
senatore ad equitem Romanum esse translatos ; ex his quasi x fiscos
ad senatorem illum relictos esse comitiorum meorum nomine3
divisores omnium tribuum noctu ad istum vocatos. Ex quibus
quidam, qui se omnia mea causa debere arbitrabatur, eadem illa
nocte ad me venit3 demonstrat qua iste oratione usus esset3 com-
memorasse istum quam liberaliter eos tractasset etiam antea quum
ipse praeturam petisset et proximis consularibus praetoriisque
comitiis3 deinde continuo esse pollicitum quantam vellent pe-
cuniam, si me aedilitate dejecissent. Hic alios negasse audere,
alios respondisse non putare id perfici posse 3 inventum tamen esse
fortem amicum ex eadem familia, Q. Verrem Romilia, ex optima

fiscos complures cum pecunia] ‘several
baskets with Sicilian money 3' filled with
some of the Sicilian phmder of Verres. ‘ Fis-
cus ' signified a basket or receptacle of
wicker-work, which the Romans used for
the holding and conveying of large sums of
money, particularly for the purposes of the
‘aerarium' or treasury. Mai, quoted by
Klotz, says that in the Vatican Museum
such a Fiscus full of money is represented
0111 011 a 510110, with a vessel near it to take
out the pieces of money with, and the in-
scription VIATOR AD AERARIVM. (See the
passages Act. ii. Lib. 3. 0. 85; and 0. 79,
‘ qui fiscum sustulit.') In the Republican
period the State, considered as possessing
property, was indicated by the term ‘ aera-
rium,’ for all 1110 functions ofthe State with
respect to property were resolvable into re-
ceiving money into the ‘ aerarium' and
paying it out. Under the Empire, that
which the emperor was entitled to, as em-
peror, from the provinces under his ad-
ministration, got the name of Fiscus ,- and
that to which the Senate was entitled in
respect of those provinces which they ad-
ministered retained the name of ‘ aerariiun?
The name ‘fiscus’ appears to have been
applied 130 1110 emperor’s treasury, because
his ‘ fisci' were more spoken of than those
of the Senate3 and finally, when all power
was concentrated in the emperor, the term
‘ fiscus ' was used to (1011010 1110 whole pro-
perty of the State 3 and it then signified
what ‘ aerarium ³ did in the republican
period. (Savigny, System des Heut. R‘om.
Rechts, ii. p. ‘2725 and Dict. of Antiqus.
Fiscus.)

serves that some foolishly ask about the
names of the persons to whom Cicero al-
ludes, as if all this were true.

ex his . . relictos] Zumpt has a note to
explain this. Several ‘ fisci ' were sent by a
senator to an ‘ eques.³ Out of 111050 ‘several'
about ten were left with the senator 3 not a
very exact way of speaking. All of them
seem to have been deposited with the sena-
tor, who kept about 1011 of them and sent
the rest away, I suppose, for some purpose.

ad . . illum . . relictos] So ‘ ad' is used.
See In Cat. i. 0. 8, vol. iii.

comitiorum effa] ‘For the purpose of
preventing my being elected curule aedile '
by bribery. The comitia aedilicia, says
Asconius, followed the consularia and prae-
toria, which is plain from this story.

divisores] Asconius asks if all the
tribes had their own ‘legitimi divisores:
such as the ‘ magistri curiarum’ referred-
to by Plautus (Aul. i. 1, 20), 01· crimina]
‘ divisoresss and he adds that, if Cicero
meant criminal ‘divisores‚’ he would not
have said that 0110 of them was dear to
him. This is a sample of the trifling which
is mixed up with better matter. The
‘divisores' were the men who managed
the distribution of bribery money, of whom
we read in the oration Pro Cn. Plancio, c.
18, 19.

onmia . . debere] We must supply
‘facere,' says Asconius. See Divianz 63
and most of the Mss. have ‘facere debere?

Q. Verrem Romilia,] or ‘Romuleas as
Zumpt has it and (111. The note of As-
conius 011 this passage is good z “ Q. Verrem
