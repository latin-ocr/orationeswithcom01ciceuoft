I. Si quis vestrum, judices, aut eorum qui adsunt, forte miratur
me, qui tot annos in causis judiciisque publicis ita sim versatus ut
defenderim multos, laeserim neminem, subito nunc mutata voluntate
ad accusandum descenderim, is si mei consilii causam rationemque
cognoverit, una et id quod facio probabit, et in hac causa profecto
neminem praeponendum mihi esse actorem putabit. Quum quaes-
tor in Sicilia fuissem, judices, itaque ex ea provincia decessissem ut
Siculis omnibus jucundam diuturnamque memoriam quaesturae
nominisque mei relinquerem, factum est uti quum summum in
veteribus patronis multis tum nonnullum etiam in me praesidium
suis fortunis constitutum esse arbitrarentur. Qui nunc populati
atque vexati cuncti ad me publice saepe venerunt, ut suarum for-
tunarum omnium causam defensionemque susciperem ; me saepe

1. miratur me,—cleseenderim] Asco-
nius, now commonly called Pseudo-As-
conius, mentions a reading ‘ descendere?
which is the reading of some MSS„ and
has been adopted by Zumpt and Iordan.
Asconius observes that ‘ descenderim ' is a
kind of solecism, unless we prefix ‘et' or
‘ idem ³ to ‘ subito.' But the text is right,
and it would be spoilt by this interpola-
tion, as well as by the change of ‘descen-
derim’ into ‘descendere' For Cicero does
not mean to say, ‘if any of you are sur-
priscd—that 1 have all at once descended to
be an accuser ;’ buthe says, ‘ if any of you
are surprised at me, that I who for so many
yearS, &c., now all at once have descended,
&c.' Cicero had appeared as an advocate
in the courts as early as B.C. 81 ; 311(1 there
are still extant two orations which he deli-
vered in B.C. 81 311(1 80. (800 Pro P. Quin-
tio 3 Pro S. Roscio Am„ vol. ii. 5 and
Brutus, c. 91).

judiciisque publicis]
on the ‘ J udicia Publica.'

actorem] ‘ Actor ' is a general term for
one who is aplaintiff. In a ‘ causa publica ³
the ‘ actor ³ was usually called ‘ accusator?
Here it means no more than the managei· of
the prosecution z asin 0. 4, “ Siculos omnes
actorem suae eausae.” According to some,
‘ actor ³ 15 properly the plaintiff in actions
‘in personam,' and ‘petitor' the plaintiff
in actions ‘in rcm.' But the general sense
of the verb ‘ agere ' is in favour of the sup-
position that ‘actor' is the most general

term that can be used.

decessissem] ‘Decedere ' is the word
applied to a governor of a province, who
leaves it when his term of office is expired ;
and it appears that it was also applicable to
a quaestor leaving his province (0. 9).
There is a reading ‘ discessissem? G 3 ς.

veteribus patronis] These old patroni,
or protectors of the Sicilians, were the Mar-
celli (Act. ii. Lib. 4. c. 40), the Scipiones,
and the Metelli. M. Marcellus, the con-
queror of Syracuse, preserved the captured
city. The younger Scipio Africanus restored
to the Sicilians the works of art which the
Carthaginians had carried away ; and Me-
tellus Celer and Nepos had on a former
occasion given the Sicilians their protection
in the prosecution of the praetor M. Lepi-
dus (Asconius). It was usual for a pro-
vince or for particular provincial cities to
choose protectors (patroni) among the
great familias of Rome.

cuncti] “ Simul omneS, quasi conjuncti '’
(Asconius). The commentator has indi-
cated the etymology of the word; for
‘ cunctus' is ‘ conimictus ’ 01 ‘ comnotus?
See Pro Archia, c. 1. It is accordingly
equivalent to ‘universi' (c. 4). Compare
‘ universa provincia ' (c. 5).

publice] ‘ Publice' means sent on a
‘public mission,' deputed by the inhabitants
of the island, or the cities of the island.
This is a common usage of the word 3 and
like the Greek κοινῇ. (800 Caesar, Β. G.
i. 16; vi. 125 vii. 55.)
