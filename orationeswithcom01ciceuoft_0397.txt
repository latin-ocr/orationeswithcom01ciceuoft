annonae] ‘Annona,' a word formed from
‘ annus,' is the current year’s produce, the
general measure of plenty or searcity ς for,
if the current year fails in any country, there
is never so large a supply on hand as to
make up the deficieney and prevent prices
rising. ‘ Annona ' often oeeurs in these ora-
tions and in the Latin writers in various
500505, 1111 of whieh are easily connected
with the primary sense. ln Lib. 3. e. 98,
it has its common sense of ‘ produces or ‘ the
year’s produce :' “Annona porro pretium
nisi in calamitate fruetuum non habet.''
It is sometimes used for the priee 01· the
necessarios of life, and particularly grain,
as in the passage of Suetonius referred to
(0. 62).

great valuc on pointiug3 but if it has a
use, it should help to the meaning and not

Klotz may understand thisas l do ; bnt it'l

readers would mismalerstand it. 'l'he

Klotz herc steps in again. like another
Alba Aemilius, to help his friend vom-es.
In reference 10 the words ‘ 111-0111101 si—
addixisses Apronio‚’ he observem that tho

main blow from his adversary fails through
the effect of these words, and yet the orator
eontrived to give the matter 511011 11 turn,
that a false appearanee, even though this
admission is made, might easily fall on
Verres if a hearer was rather inatten-
tim—This 15 something like the meaning·
ot¹ what hc says3 but it is hard to express.
He adds, “one thing only is true, that 00
this occasion some one was willing to oli'er
more.'’ This is a complete fiilsilieation
of the text; and a reader 0101 seara-ely he
so inattentive as to let this false appear-
111100 deceive him. Cicero says that Yerres
sold the ‘decumae ’ i'or less hy Xxx than he
could have done. 110 11005 not. admit that

(addictae) to Apronius when this oss'er was
made; and he adds, that even it· he should
admit that they had been 1111111111011101110
Apronius, Verres cannot deny that an oss'er
was made (palam res gesta est) to give xxx
more than Apronius had given. And that
would be 11 good proof that Verres had
acted like a knave.
