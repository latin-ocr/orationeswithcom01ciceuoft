646 “NON MODO,” &c

similar passage in Lib. 1. c. 46, where ‘ non modo ceteros ’ is followed
by ‘sed te ipsum.' There are other examples where ‘non modo,’ fol·
lowed by ‘ sed ' only, is, or seems to be, equivalent to ‘ non modo ’ fol-
lowed by ‘ sed etiam.’ (See Verr. ii. Lib. 2. c. 203 Pro Milone, c. 43 Pro
Cluentio, c. 403 In Cat. ii. c. 12 3 Sallust, Cat. c. 18.)

In the following passage (Lib. 4. c. 41) ‘non modo ’ cannot be ren-
dered by ‘ not only,’ and it confirms what I have said as to ‘ sed :’ “ Tu
ista stultitia, nequitia, inertia, non modo totius Siciliae sed unius tenuis-
simi Siculi clientelam tueri potes? ”

In the following passages also ‘ non modo ' cannot be translated ‘not
only :'—

Divin. c. 18.—“ quid habes quod possis dicere quamobrem non modo mihi sed cuiquam
anteponare ⁸? ''

Lib. 3. c. 31.—“An poterat non modo Apronius sed quivis, si exercitui metiendum
esset, improbare Siculum frumentum,” ἀρ.

Divin. c. S.-—“ quo tempore aut qua in re non modo specimen ceteris aliquid de te, sed
tute tui periculum fecisti P '²

The second instance, perhaps, shows most clearly how we must endea-
vour to express the ‘ non modo ⁷ in such cases as these: “ Ι don't ask if
Apronius could, but if any one could refuse to accept Sicilian corn ?'’

We must seek in the primitive meaning of ‘ modo ’ a solution for the
true meaning of these expressions. ‘ Modo,' like several other words in
an ablative case, is used as an adverb3 it is a word of measure, and
therefore of limitation. Professor Key remarks (Latin Grammar, §794‚
lst edit.) that ‘ modo’ means literally ‘ by measure,’ and “ hence, with
small quantities, modo, by measure, may be translated by only : on the
other hand, with great quantities, admodum, up to the measure, is equi-
valent to full, quite.” So Cicero says (Lib. 3. c. 5) z “id fuit mihi
gratum admodum :’' ‘ that was agreeable to me, to the full, to the corn-
plete measure.’ In Lib. 3. c. 97, he says, “Atque utinam posset aliqua
ratione hoc crimen quamvis falsa, modo humana atque usitata, de-
fendere,’' which means that Cicero would be glad if Verres could
answer this charge in some way, as false as you like, within the limits
of ‘ humanitas' and usage. So in Lib. 3. c. 87, there is “ magnum
praeclarumque vectigal, si modo salva provincia, si sine injuria sociorum
percipere possumus ².'’ Now here the ‘ modo ’ might be omitted, but it
· helps to express more clearly the condition or limitation, which limita-
tion is the existence· and integrity of the province. One more example
may help to explain this. Lib. 3. c. 58: ‘⁶ hoc aut innocens homo per-
peti potuisset, aut quamvis nocens, qui modo judicia Romae fore putaret,

² The usagcs of ‘ modo' in Terence may be compared. Caesar also uses ‘admodum '
111 a way which shows its meaning, ‘ turres admodum CXX excitantur ' (B. G. v. 40).
