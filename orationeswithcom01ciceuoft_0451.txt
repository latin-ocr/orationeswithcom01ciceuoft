FORMULA OCTAVIANA. 433

offences to which that Lex applied3 and this, which is an argument in
favour of the analogy between the Octaviana Formula and the Lex de
Repetundis, is also in favour of some form of the word ‘ auferre ' being
contained in the Formula. Repetundae comprehended both the offence
of receiving money as a gift—a bribe, for instance—aud also the getting
of money by force and threats. The ‘ Aetio quod metus causa ’ could
have no reference to gifts, because a gift from one private person to
another is a transaction which does not come under the head of things
forbidden3 but the obtaining of money, or any thing valuable from
another by threats and force, is preeisely the act to which the Formula
Octaviana applied.

The position of the defendant in the ‘Actio quod metus eausa’ shows
also that this ‘actio' is framed after the model of the proceedings in
the case of Repetundae. The principle of the action is not only to
punish the man who has used ⁴ vis et metus‚’ but to restore the injured
party to all his rights. Accordingly the ‘Actio quod metus ' could be
maintained even against artificial persons, though they are not capable
of committing a delict (Dig. 4. 2. 9. ἓ 1. 3) ; also against the
‘ heredes ’ of the person who had used ‘ vis et metus‚' though they had
taken no personal share in the compulsion3 against third persons who
had derived some direct advantage from the application of the ‘vis et
metus‚’ though as a general rule third persons are not affected by the
acts of others. It also holds against those who have acquired by singular
succession, if they have got the profit which the person who used
compulsion derived from the act (Dig. 4. 2. 14. ξ 5), though as ageneral
rule personal plaints do not pass from one defendant to another. But
these persons, who may become liable to the plaintiff, are only hable so
far as the advantage derived from the ‘metus et vis’ has come to their
hands (quantum ad eos pervenit), and at the time of the commencement
of the aetion is still a part of their property (Dig. 4. 2. 20). The prin-
ciple was that the gain which had acerued from the unlawful aet could
be recovered from any person to whom it could be traccd. If the thing
was consmned, neither the wrong-door nor his ‘ heres' was released; the
‘ aetio ’ is ‘ perpetua.' If it has perishcd‚ a third person iu whose
hands it was, is released3 but if such person has parted with the thing,
which was originally wrongfully gotten, hc is still liable3 for the thing
having been exehanged for money, or any thing else, he must be eonsi-
dered to have been a gamer, even if that thing afterwards perish or is
eonsumed.

The object of the ‘Actio quod metus ‘ is clearly then, in the case of
private wr011g-doerS‚ the same as that of the proceedings for chetundae
in the case of Magistratus. The object of the clause ‘quo ca pecunia
pervenerit‚' and the extension of the action to third persons, is to give
