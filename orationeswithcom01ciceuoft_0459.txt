AOT. II. LIBER QUARTUS. 441

visuntum nam alia visendi causa nulla est. Atque ille L. Mum-
mius, quum Thespiadas quae ad aedem Felicitatis sunt, ceteraque
profana ex illo oppido signa tolleret, huno marmoreum Cupidinem
quod erat consecratus non attigit. III. Verum ut ad illud sacra-
rium redeam, signum erat hoc quod dieo Cupidinis e marmore: ex
altera parte Hercules egregie faetus ex aere. Is dicebatur esse
Myronis, ut opinor3 et certe. Item ante hos deos erant arulae
quae cuivis religionem sacrarii significare possent. Erant aenea
duo praeterea signa, non maxima, verum eximia venustate, virginali
habitu atque vestim, quae manibus sublatis sacra quaedam more

Atheniensium virginum reposita in capitibus sustinebant.

taet, and he is only mistaken in saying that
the statue of Heius was the statue of Thes-
piae3 not a small mistake however. He
further adds, that this explains why 110 0011-
sidered the other statue to be still at Pa-
riun13 that is, one blundel· explains another.
For, if Sillig is right in supposing that the
statue of Heius was the Pal-ian statue, Pliny
was quite wrong in saying that it was still
at Parium. He must have made the asser-
tion without making inquiry. The Thes—
pian was at R0me3 he knew that: and
yet he did not know how it came there,
though Nero brought it, and he was living
when it came.

L. Mummius] See Lib. 1. c. 21.

Thespiadas] 'rho Greek accusative.
¹ These were the figures of the Musae, men-
tioned by Pliny (H. N. xxxiV. e. 8, ed.
Hardnin.): “signa quae ante aedem Feli-
citatis fuere, Veneremque, quae eum ipsa
aede incendio cremata est Claudii princi-
pum, marmoreae illi suae per terras in-
clytae parem.'' This Venus and the Thes-
piades were bronze figures. See 0. 57,
note on tho temple of Felicitas.

profana] The meaning is explained by
the contrast with ‘ mmm-ratus: that which
is devoted to rcligious pai-poses.

3. ,Hm-onis] Α skilful artist in bronze
(Pliny, H. N. xxxi. 8, cd. Ilard.), was a
Boeotian, born about ina-180. The 1111110115
Hercules of Myron was at Samos. and
thero was another at Rome. 'l‘his of Heius
may have been by Myron; or, what came
to the same thing, it was said to be by
Myron. 111 ancient times, as in modern,
there was often more than 0110 original. lt
was not a colossal statue, like thc Hercules
of Samos (Strabo, p. 637, cd. casaub).

arulae] Small altars. 'rho inferior MSS„
aud the old editions, have ‘ tabulae)

Canephoroe] This word represents the
Greek κανηφόροι, the carriers ofthe κανοῦν,
or basket. Cicero accurately describes the
composition of these figureS, not like an
‘i(liotes,' bnt like a man of taste. Pliny
(H. N. xxxvi. c. 5, ed. Hard.) mentions
Canephoroe by Scopas, but not by Praxi-
teles. Canephoroe walked in processions
at Athens at great festivals (Thucyd. vi.
56). They are described by Ovid (Metam.
ii. 713) :—

“ Illa forte die castae (le more puellae

Vertiee supposito festas in Palladis
arces

Pura coronatis portabant sacra ca-
nistris.''

An ‘ antefixa’ in the British Musenm
represents two ‘ eanephoroc ' approaching a
‘ candelabrum ς’ 0110 arm supports the has-
ket 011 the head, and the other slightly
raises the dress. 'l'hc (τιν-1411111 figures, as
to tho origin of which Vitruvius gives so
ahsurd a story, belong to the same style as
the. Canephoroe. They were employed 111

portico. These statcly ligures, walking·

are. probably allnded to by Horace, 1 Sat.
iii. 10:

——- “persaepe velut qui
,Iunonis sacra fer1·ct,''

and 2 Sat. viii. 13. and Heindorf's 110105.
Α ‘canephoros’ of Artemis 15 mentioned
(Theocr. ii. 611).

Sed earum arbjficem. . . . Polyclitum]
‘ Polyclitum ’ appears to he the 11511111 Latin
form, as Zumpt shows, not ‘Polyi-letum?
Cicero here uses an artifice, which he pro-
bably horrowcd si om the Athenian orators.
