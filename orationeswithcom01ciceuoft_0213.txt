SPONSIONES. 195

called ‘ Sponsio praejudicialis ς’ and the defendant, if judgment was given
against him, did not pay the amount of the Sponsio. This Sponsio was
a pure form 3 and, as Gaius says (iv. 94), ‘ propter hoc solum fit ut per
eam de re judicetur.’ In this case the plaintiff only makes the ‘ stipu-
latio.’ But the object of the Sponsio might be also to mulct the defen-
dant3 and in that case the defendant has a ‘restipulatio’ against the
plaintiff, that is, he can say to him ⁶ spondes ἴθ’ and require the answer
‘ spondeo.’ This would be a ‘ sponsio poenalis.’

The ‘in rem actio: as the Romans termed it, was when a man claimed
the ownership of a corporeal thing, or when he claimed some right with
respect to a corporeal thing, as a ‘usus fructus,‘ or a right of road over
a piece of land (Graius, iv. 3). The claim could be made by the ‘ formula
petitoria,’ of which we have an example in Cicero (Verr. Lib. 2. c. 12) 3
and in this case the defendant had to give ‘ satisdatio judicatum solvi ’
(Verr. Lib. 1. c. 453 Gaius, iv. 91). Or the claim could be made by
the Sponsio, in which case the plaintiff called upon the defendant in
such terms as follow: “si homo quo de agitur ex jure Quiritium meus
est, sestertios cxxv nummos dare spondes ?’' With reference to this
‘ stipulatio‚’ the Formula contained the following ‘ intenti0,’ that is, the
demand of the plaintiff, eonverted into a conditional form: ‘ si paret
N. N. A. A. ss. cxxv nummos dare oportere,’ and the defendant gave
security, in case the plaintiff's right was established, for the restoration
of the property and the intel-mediate profits ; that is, there was a ‘ stipu-
latio pro praede litis et vindiciarum.’ The object of the security in both
cases was to give the plaintiff, if his claim was established, and the thing
was not given up to him, or the value of it, a right of aetion against the
defendant or his Sponsores founded on the ‘satisdatio.' XVhen a man
claimed a thing by the Sponsio, he did not claim it directly, as the
Formula shows, but he claimed a certain sum of money as due, the
amount mentioned in the Sponsio, if the thing was proved to be his.
Thus the ‘in rem actio’ was in form converted into an ‘actio in per-
sonam,’ that is, an ‘ actio ⁷ founded on conti-act (Gaius, iv. 2).

Part of this has been said before (Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 45, note); but the
matter will perhaps be better understood after this explanation. Cicero
(Lib. 3. c. 57) says, “ L. Rubrius Q. Apronium sponsione lacessivit, ni
Apronius dictitaret te sibi in decumis csse socium.’' Here ‘ sponsione
lacessere ' is said of him who was the plaintiff. In c. 59, ‘⁴ cum eodem
Apronio postea. P. Scandilius . . eandem sponsionem fecit—sacta est
sponsio.’' P. Scandilius was the actor or plaintiff, as appears srom what
follows3 and ‘sponsionem facere ' applies to him ‘qui stipulatur‚' and
the expression seems to apply to him more properly than to him ‘ qui
promittit.’ But it is certain that ‘ sponsionem facere ' can also be
applied to him ‘qni promittit ’ (Lib. 5. c. 54, note3 and Keller, Semes-
