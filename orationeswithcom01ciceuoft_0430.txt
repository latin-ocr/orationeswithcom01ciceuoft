412 IN O. VERREM

crimine isto genere defensionis uteris? Sunt quaedam omnino in
te singularia, quae in nullum hominem alium ch‘ci neque convenire
possint; quaedam tibi cum multis communia. Ergo, ut omittam
tuos peculatus, ut ob jus dicendum pecunias acceptas, ut ejusmodi
cetera quae forsitan alii quoque etiam fecerint3 illud, in quo te
gravissime accusavi, quod ob judicandam rem pecuniam accepisses,
eadem ista ratione defendes, fecisse alios? Ut ego assentiar ora-
tioni, defensionem tamen non probabo. Potius enim te damnato ’
ceteris angustior locus improbitatis defendendae relinquetur, quam .
te absoluto alii quod audacissime fecerunt recte fecisse existi-
mentur.

LXXXIX. Lugent omnes provinciae: queruntur omnes liberi
populi: regna denique omnia de nostris cupiditatibus et injuriis
expostulant: loeus intra oceanum jam nullus est neque tam longin-
quus neque tam reconditus, quo non per haec tempora nostrorum
hominum libido iniquitasque pervaserit. Sustinere jam populus
Romanus omnium nationum, non Vim, non arma, non bellum, sed
luctus, lacrimas, querimonias non potest. In ejusmodi re ac mori-

going to speak of the supposed defence of
others having done other things; for the
words ‘Cur in hoc uno‚' δια, iinply that
Verres is going to defend what he did, by
saying that others had done other things.
Cicero accordingly says in reply to ‘ Fece-
runt alii,’ ‘ Quid, alia quam multa ?'
‘ Well, others have done other things, and
how many ,2³ which would mean a great
many. He then continues, ‘ Why do you
adopt this mode of defence in the case of
this one particular charge against you?’
V llas ‘ cur in hoc crimine)

There still remains another mode of ex-
plaining this passage. If we omit the
‘quid‚' we may write ‘Fecerunt alii ali-
quam multa,' ‘others have done a good
many things ς’ or ‘Fecerunt alii. Quid,
aliquam multaP' ‘others have done so.
Well, suppose they have done a good many
things? See Lib. 4. c. 25, on ‘aliquam
multa? As to the argument ‘Fecisse
alios,' (ἵζω, Lambinus refers to a passage in
the oration of Demosthenes against Andro-
tion (ο. 2), where Demosthenes is handling
similar matter: φήσει τοίνυν ἁπάσας . . .
ὥσπερ γὰρ, εἴ τις ἐκείνων προήλω, σὺ τάδ’
οὐκ ἂν ἔγραψας, οὕτως, ἂν σὺ νῦν δίκην δῷς,
ἄλλος οὐ γράψει. He contrasts the con-
densed and subtle style of the Athenian
with the copiousness and fulness of the
Roman. The matter of the two passages
is the same, and one might almost suppose

that there is something of imitation in
Cicero, particularly if we compare the con-
cluding words of the Greek with the last
sentence of this chapter. The manner of
the two orators is very different. Each
has his merits3 but the severer taste will
prefer the Athenian. Lambinus also com-
pares a passage from the Busiridis Enco-
mium of Isocrates (c. 18), ἐπεὶ τόν ’γε
λόγον ὃν συνέγραψας, οὐκ ἀπολογίαν ὑπὲρ
Βουσίριδος ἀλλὰ ὁμολογίαν τῶν ἐγκαλουμέ-
νων δικαίως ἄν τις εἶναι νομίσειεν, &c. The
style of Isocrates here is not unlike that of
Cicero in this passage, full and flowing,
but less vigorous than that of the Roman.

89. denique] ‘denique etiam' V and
Klotz.

intra oceanum] This means on this side
of the ‘oceanus‚' from the straits of Gib-
raltar eastwards3 within the habitable or
known world. Juvenal expresses the sanie
notion in other words, Sat. x. 1 :

“Omnibus in terris quae sunt a Gadi-
bus usque
Auroram et Gangem.”

In another passage Cicero expresses him-
self still more clearly, De Imp. Cn. Pomp.
c. 12, “nunc nullam iutra Oceani ostium
praedonum navem esse.’¹

luetus‚] Only 111 Lg. 42. V and the
rest have ‘ luctunl.’—-‘ manifestis in flagitiis:
