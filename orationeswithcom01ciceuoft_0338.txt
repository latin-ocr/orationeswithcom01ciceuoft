320 IN O. VERREM

improbitate deplorare et conqueri mallent. Quas literas quum ad
omnes civitates prope suppliciter misisset Metellus, tamen anti-
quum modum sationis nulla ex parte assequi potuit: diffugerant
enim permulti, id quod ostendam3 nec solum arationes sed etiam
sedes suas patrias istius injuriis exagitati reliquerant.

Non mehercule augendi criminis causa, judices, dicam: sed
quem ipse accepi oculis animoque sensum, hunc vere apud vos Ἴ
et ut potero planissime exponam. Nam quum quadriennio post
in Siciliam venissem, 'sic mihi affecta visa est ut hae terrae solent
in quibus bellum acerbum diuturnumque versatum est. Quos ego
campos antea collesque nitidissimos viridissimosque vidissem, hos
ita vastatos nunc ac desertos videbam ut ager ipse cultorem
desiderare ac lugere dominum videretur. Herbitensis ager, Hen-
nensis, Murgentinus, Assorinus, Imacharensis, Agyrinensis, ita
relictus erat ex maxima parte ut non solum jugerum sed etiam
dominorum multitudinem quaereremus; Aetnensis vero ager qui
solebat esse cultissimus, et, quod caput est rei frumentariae, cam-
pus Leontinus cujus antea species haec erat ut, quum obsitum
vidisseS, annonae caritatem non vererere, sic erat deformis atque
horridus ut in uberrima Siciliae parte Siciliam quaereremus. Labe-
factarat enim vehementer aratores jam superior annus, proximus
vero funditus everterat.

hae terrae solent] V has ‘eae‚’ &c., a sive. plain through which the Lissus flows.

variation which Ι note, that the reader
may better understand how frequently
these two forms, in certain caseS, are in-
terchanged or used indifferently.

IlIurgyentinusfl This is the MSS. read-
ing. There are also the forms Μοργάντιον,
Μοργαντίνη, Μοργαντῖνος. The Greek form
on the coins is Mop‘yau and Μοργαντινα.
See Excursus viii. The site of the place is
uncertain. Livy (24, c. 27) speaks of it
as on the coast. Diodorus seems to place
it north-west of the plain of Leontini.

The codd. herc have ‘ Macharensis?
Pliny (iii. c. 8) has ‘Imacarenses.' The
site of the place is uncertain, but Ima-
chara scems, like the othcr towns here
mentioned, to be in the corn country in-
cluded between Henna and Aetna, and
extending south to Leontini.

jugerum] V. has ‘jng0rum,' accepted
by Klotz and Iordan. The context shows
that ‘jugerum ' is the true word. ‘ Quae-
reremus ' is equivalent to ‘ desiderarenms,’
‘1 looked in yain for ς’ and so it is used
again shortly after in this chapter.

cwmpus Leontinus,] This is the exten-

This river is described in ancient times as
entering a lake, and issuing from it in
two branches, one of which was navigable.
This is now the lake of Biviere, near Len-
tini, the site of the ancient Leontini. This
lake, “ in its greatest winter extent, is about
nineteen miles in circumfer-enee, but it de-
creases, as the sun advances, to eight or
nine, leaving a feculent bed of mud and
marsh on its banks, that, during the sum-
mer exhalations, tcems with pestilence and
death ” (Smyth’s Sicily, p. 158). Smyth
adds that this inconvenience might be
easily removed, “ as there is a communica-
tion by the rivulet of San Leonardo with
the sea, which might easily be deepened.'’
This rivulet may be the ancient Terias.
(Thucyd. vi. 50.) Swinburne describes the
plain along the coast as full of ponds
and marshes, which abound with wild fowl.
After leaving the fens, he came upon a
“ noble plain, covered with promising crops
of corn, but without a single enclosure, or
even tree.'' Polybius (vii. 6) describes the
position of Leontini. The corn plains lie
north of the city.
