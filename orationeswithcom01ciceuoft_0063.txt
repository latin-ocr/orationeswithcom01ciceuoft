REPETUNDAE. 45

suppose) proposed by O. Servilius Glaucia, a Tribunus Plebis, made
material additions to the Quaestio de Repetundis. It made not only
provincial Magistratus, but- all Magistratus and even J udices liable to
prosecution for misconduct in the administration of justice. The chap-
ters of the Lex contained many particular provisions3 the chief of which
was the following (c. 1); “quantum—ablatum captum coactum conci-
liatum aversumve sit, de ea re eius petitio nominisque delatio esto.'’
The time fixed for the trial of matters which concerned the provincials
was the summer months before the Kalends of September, in order that
the proceedings might not be interrupted by the numerous holidays, if
they were commenced later (Cic. Act. i. c. 10). After the ‘nominis
delatio,' or formal commencement of the proceedings, the Praetor named
the persons (patroni, actores) who were to conduct the prosecutiou on
the part of the complainants; but Peregrini might conduct their own
case if they liked. Klenze is of opinion, that kings and free peoples,
who were complainants, had the choice of conducting their case either by
their Legati or by Patroni; but individual Peregrini and subject peoples
were required to have Patroni. The J udices, the whole number of whom
was 450 (the numerals CDL occur several times in the fragment of the
Servilia Lex), were annually appointed by the Praetor, whose duty it
was to preside in this court ; and their names with the addition of the
designation of their tribe were put on a tablet (album) in a public place.
The accuser and the accused selected each 100 J udices from the list3
and each had to challenge 50, so that 100 remained ³. This took place
twenty days after the ⁶ nominis delatio,’ and the names of the 100
J udices were placed on a tablet. The accused had to give ‘vadimonium ’
or security for his appearance, and if he went into exile before the verdict
was given, he was condemned to pay the amount of damages mentioned
in the declaration. The Judices were required to give their votes in
writing. One of the Chapters related to the reward for the accusers,
which in the case of a Peregrinus was the conferring of the ‘ civitas ' on
one at whose instance a Roman was convicted of Repetundae (Cic. Pro
Balbo, c. 24). The Lex also provided fo'r a second hearing by means of
a ‘comperendinatio’ (Verr. Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 9). It also provided, like
the Lex Calpurnia, that a Roman citizen might have his civil action
(legis actio sacramento) to recover damages, or might proeeed crimi-
nally. Peregrini were not allowed to have this ‘ legis actio,’ which was
a mode of procceding strictly Roman, that is, peculiar to Roman
citizens. The Servilia Lex expresses the differencc between these two

Romani, Bologua, 1574. He says “cujus frag-mentum ogo, cum Patavii profiterer.
reperi iu nobilissimo Petri chhi cardinalis musaeo iu aencis tabulis vetustissimis
incisum?
