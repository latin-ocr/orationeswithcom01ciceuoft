Μ. TULLII CICERONIS

Q. CAECILIUM ORATIO

AOOUSATORE IN O. VERREM OONSTITUENDO, -

QUAE

DIVINATIO

DICITUR.

The Sicilians, with the exception of the Syracusans and the Mamertini, had asked
Cicero to conduct their case against Verres 3 and, after he had consented, he applied
to the praetor Μ’. Acilius Glabrio, who during this year presided in the Quaestiones
perpetuae de pecuniis repetundis, for permission to be the accuser. Q. Caecilius
Niger also put in his claim, though the Sicilians had not asked him, and did not
want him. There were sufficient reasons why injured parties should not have the
power of naming the person who should conduct their case, when the prosecution
was a matter which concerned the public interest. There had sometimes been
collusion between the guilty persons and those who came to demand satisfaction of
them, or to bring them to punishment. The accused would secretly compound with
their prosecutors for a sum of money, and the trial would be so managed as to result
in an acquittal, and so the crimina] would be secured against further risk. To
prevent such an impudent fraud, the Lex, which defined each particular offence for
which a man might be brought to a J udicium Publicum, provided that the J udices
should choose the accuser, at least in cases where more than one person claimed the
office. The practice was maintained under the Empire, as we see from a passage of
Ulpian (Dig. 48. 2. 16): “Si plures exsistant qui eundem publicis judiciis accusare
volunt, judex eligere debet eum qui accuset ς causa scilicet cognita, aestimatis
accusatorum personis vel de dignitate vel ex eo quod interest, vel aetate, vel moribus,
vel alia justa de causa.”

There is 110 evidence that Glabrio presided in this preliminary inquiry, nor that the
J udices were those who sat on the trial of Verres. It seemS, however, most likely that
Glabrio would preside 3 and Cicero says (Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 6), that several of those who
were J udices on the trial of Verres had also acted as J udices in this preliminary
inquiry. This is all that can be affirmed in the absence of direct evidence. The deci-
sion of the J udices in such a matter as this was not founded on any evidence, but on
the speeches of the rival claimants‚ each of whom supported his own case by argument,
and endeavoured to weaken the claim of his opponent. The J udices had to form their
judgment‚ as well as they could, 011 what they thus heard. This ‘ actio de accusatore
constituendo’ was called ‘Divinatioj or divining3 apparently because the Judices
could do no more than make a kind of guess or probable conclusion as to the fitness of
the opposing claimants. Asconius (commonly called Pseudo-Asconius) 111 his argument
