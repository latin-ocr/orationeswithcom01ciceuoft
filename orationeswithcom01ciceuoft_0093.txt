Q. Calidius] He had been praetor in

‘judices’
Spain, ΒΕ. 78, and was tried on a charge of

This, as Asconius remarks, m‘ll
answer the question, What connexion is

Repetundae, and condemned. His ‘judices,'
it appeared, were bribedwitha moderate sum
to convict him ς and the accused said that a
man of his rank could not be convicted
honourably to the ‘judices' for less than
‘ tricies ς’ which was as much as to say that,
if they sold themselveS‚ they ought to get
a good price. Zumpt reads “Hs ᾖξ’
and adds, “mihi nunc ᾗ, i. e. quae sin-
guli judices acceperint satis videtur, siqui-
dem in causa Cluentiana, c. 26, quadragena
dabantur.” ‘ HSXXX codd. plerique?

lis aestimata sit] The ‘ litis aestimatio '
in crimina] matters was this: if a person
was condemned in a criminal trial, it might
be necessary in some cascS, as in trials foi
Repetundae, and for receiving a bribe as a
‘judex' (ob judicandum), to ascertaiu and
assess the damages or amount which thc
condemned person had to pay ; and this
was the ‘litis aestimatio! This man, P.
Septimius Scaevola, was tried ΒΩ. 7 2, but
it does not appear on what charge. In the
‘litis aestimatio’ account was taken, it is
said, of his having received a bribe in liis
capacity of ‘judex ’ (oh rem judicandam).
Cicero alludes to him in the Pro Cluentio,
c. 41.

ob rem judicandam] Comp. Pro Rabirio
Post. c. 7.

peculatus] ‘ peculatus ' is the ofl'ence of
a man appropriating public money (pecunia
publica) to his own use. Atilius was con-
victed on a charge of Majestus, as Cicero
observes3 and it further appears that he
and the others, Herminius and Popillius,
had also been guilty of receiving bribes as

there between a man being convicted of
‘peculatus’ by the senatorian ‘judices'
and the charge of judicial corruption
against the same ‘judices?' “Respon-
debimus litis aestimationem [ficri] non
solum ex titulo propositi criminis, sedetiam
ex aliis probationibus, quae cx ante actis
rebus apud judices constiterint. Hi pecu-
latus crimine proposito etiam quas judi-
cando pecunias ceperant reddiderunt.''
sortiente] This word expresses the
practor's activity in his office as presidiug
at a trial. The case alluded to in the words
‘ exirent in cum reum,’ is that of Oppiani-
cus, whom one of the ‘judices ’ was charged
with voting against, though hc had hot.
heard the evidence. Though Cicero uses
the plural ‘exirent,’ there was onlv one
person to whom the charge did appli, and
even he (C. Fidiculanius Falcula) w‘as ue.-
quitted of the charge, as Cicero tells us
(l'ro Cluentio, c. 37). Though he was ge-
nerally suspected to have heen guiltv, it
suited Cicero's purpose, when speaking: for
Cluentius, to consider him innocent.

‘ Exircnt in eum reum ' means ‘were
hostile to‚' or something of the kind. For-
eellini explains ‘ exire in aliquem ‘ bv ⁸ iu-
festo animo ire,’ but he gives exmnple‘s only
from Statius.

qui quum jude-r ess-el, in eodem judicio]
This man, who was charged with taking}
money in the Judicium Juniunum from
both sides, was (Χ Aelius Stalemffi or
Staienus, who is mentioued in the oration
Pro Cluentio, c. 24, ἃς.
