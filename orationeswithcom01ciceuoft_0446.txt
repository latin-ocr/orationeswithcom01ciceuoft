largest corn-growing states, the average produce of wheat is about 25
bushels the English acre (1860). On a good soil with little labour they
get in America what pays them, though it is not much. When it will
pay to get more, they can have it by more labour.

Mr. F. F. Hallett, of Kemp Town, Brighton, is attempting to increase
the productiveness of our corn-fields on the same principle by which we
have improved our breeds of cattle, by a repeated selection of the finest
ears of wheat, which possess the properties of tillering well and produc-
ing large ears, But after selection of seed it is also necessary to give
the plants the opportunity of growing, and he does this by allowing each
grain sufficient room to grow in. He thus makes a great saving in seed
and secures a larger crop. He informs me that there are instances in
England where so much seed is used for sowing and the soil is so poor,
that the proportion between the seed and the produce is not larger than
that mentioned above in the case of Piedmont. Such an extreme result
may be rare, but the general proportion in England between the seed
sown and the produce is very different from the result of his experi-
ments.

On twenty-three acres of land, very much exhausted, he sowed five
gallons the acre, dibbled, but not in single grains. The crop was 736
bushels or 51 fold.

On one acre he sowed five pints of seed; the grains were planted
separately‚ and twelve inches apart every way. This crop was planted
much too late, and was greatly iujured by wireworm. The produce was
40 bushels or 500 fold.

On 698 square feet, planted with ‘Hallett’s pedigree nursery wheat,'
the grains planted singly nine inches apart every way, the crop was 1·'7 5
bushels or 8042 sold.

Mr. Hallett's principle is briefly this. A grain of wheat, like other
grains and seeds, requires a certain area to grow in and develope itself
according to its nature. Wheat cannot do this if it is sown or planted
thick. Ι have seon one of Mr. Hallett’s wheat plants of this year (1861),
which has the enormous number of 52 stems from one root and one
grain, each stem bearing a full long ear something like double the length
os ordinary ears. By selecting good seed and planting the grains wide
apart he obtains a strong plant with many stems and large heads. His
field may contain no more stems than other people find on their fields
when they have sowed two bushels or more of seed; but his plants are
strouger, less liable to be laid, and he gains in the length of the ear.
Every plant requires a certain horizonta] area for its proper growth3
but its growth in the vertical direction‚ in the ear, is independent of the
other condition.
