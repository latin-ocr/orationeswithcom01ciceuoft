PREFACE ΤΟ ΤΗΕ SECOND ED1T1ON. xi

corrected some mistakes. I wish Ι could say that Ι have cleared
the book of all error-53 but as that is not possible, Ι must be
content with having done my best to explain one of the most
valuable monuments either of ancient or modern literature.

Having received many remarks from diligent students of Cicero,
Ι have made use of them whenever Ι could3 and in some cases
where Ι could not, Ι have given additional reasons for keeping the
explanation which Ι had already given.

I shall have no opportunity of revising this volume a third
time. With all its defects, andI have no doubt that they are many,
I hope it may assist the readers of Cicero. Some years hence
somebody will take these orations in hand again, and if he shall

find that what I have done is useful, he may improve it by striking
out all that is useless or incorrect. ⁴
