642 SICILY A ROMAN PROVINCE.

barley, which the governor was empowered to demand of the Sicilians
for the use of his household (in cellam). The amount that he could
demand was fixed3 he was furnished by the Roman state with money
to pay for it; and the price that he had to pay was fixed. Here Cicero
informs us of a monstrous abuse which was established as a regular
practice. A governor could require the grain for his use to be deli-
vered at any place that he named within the province. If the cult-i-
vator had no corn to sell, or if he did not wish to sell his corn at the
price that he would receive, or if 116 wished to avoid the expense of car-
rying it to the placenamed by the governor, he prayed as a favour that
he might be allowed, instead of delivering the corn which was re-
quired of him, to pay a sum of money equal to its value. This mon-
strous abuse is lightly touched by Cicero, for the ‘judices ’ in the case
of Verres were men who would have a fellow·feeling with the accused.
The charge against Verres was that he got more money out of the Sici-
lians under the head of ‘frumentum aestimatum ’ than other governors3
more thau he would have got, if he had done as other governors did and
were allowed to do. They were greedy. Verres was greedier. (Lib. 3.
c. 81.)

The administration of Verres lasted three years, during which the
island was ruined by his oppression. Cicero may have exaggerated the
vices of Verres when he speaks of him in general terms, but it· is hardly
possible that the numerous charges against him, which he states with so
much precision, can be far from the truth. Such a system of oppression
sor three years in a country within a few days' sail of Rome is a foul
stain ou the character of the Roman senate, who held the administration
in their hands. Nothing but a consciousness that they were as guilty
as Verres could have prevented the senate from visiting this scoundrel
with speedy and well-merited punishment. The administration of Sicily
under Verres gives us a just measure of the corruption of the Roman
nobles, and prepares us for the advent of the imperial system, the only
possible government if the empire was to subsist.

One of the many modes of raising money which Verres resorted to
remains to be mentioned. He got money from the Sicilians under the
pretext of applying it to the erection of statues of himself ; and in fact
there were statues of Verres, his son, and his father, erected in Sicily
during his administration at the expense of the Sicilians3 and statues of
Verres even in Rome. But statues were also made a pretext for get-
ting money, which Verres kept3 and the law was so considerate, that it
allowed a period of five years to elapse before a governor could be called
to account for not appropriating the money to the purposes for which it
was given or extorted (Lib. 2. c. 58). The practice of erecting statues,
temples, and altars 130 Roman governors was the invention of the
