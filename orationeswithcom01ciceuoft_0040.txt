22 IN Q. CAECILIUM
adfuturos. Quare negent ex. me non audies: hos patere id suspi-
cari quod necesse est. Illi quidem, ut est hominum genus nimis
acutum et suspiciosum, non te ex Sicilia litteras in Verrem depor-
tare velle arbitrantur, sed quod iisdem litteris illius praetura et tua
quaestura consignata sit, asportare te velle ex Sicilia litteras suspi-
cantur. Deinde accusatorem firmum verumque esse oportet. Eum
ego si te putem cupere esse, facile intelligo esse non posse. N ec ea
dico quae, si dicam, tamen infirmare 11011 possis, te antequam de ,
Sicilia decesseris in gratiam redisse cum Verre3 Potamonem scri-
bam et familiarem tuum retentum esse a Verre in provincia, quum
tu decederes ; M. Caecilium, fratrem tuum, lectissimum atque orna—
tissimum adolescentem, non modo non adesse neque tecum tuas
injurias persequi, sed esse cum Verre, et cum illo familiarissime
atque amicissime vivere. Sunt et haec et alia in te falsi accusatoris
signa permulta, quibus ego nunc non utor : hoc dico, te, si maxime
cupias, tamen verum accusatorem esse non posse. Video enim per-
multa esse crimina quorum tibi societas cum Verre ejusmodi est ut
ea in accusando attingere non audeas.

X. Queritur Sicilia tota C. Verrem ab aratoribus, quum frumen-
tum sibi in cellam imperavisset, et quum esset tritici modius HS
II, pro frumento in modios singulos duodenos sestertios exegisse.

9. ut est hominum genus] Klotz re-
marks that Cicero cast-s a slight censure on
the sharpness and jealousy of the Sicilians,
to let Caecilius know what 110 may expect,
if he obtrudes himself on them as their
‘ pat1·0nus.’ As to the use of ‘ ut‚' compare
De Sen. 0. 4, ‘ut 111 1101111110 Romano ς’
De Or. iii. 18 3 and Caesar, Β. G. 111. 8. vii.
22.

depo›rare—asportare] The false Asco-
nius explains ‘ deportare ³ correetly enough,
as far as he goeS, ‘ 1113 mutet locum 3⁵ as to
‘asportare' he says, ‘ut intereat? ‘De-
portare,' or ‘ deferre,' means to bring thc
documents to Rome, or such other place as
the person was ordered 130 bring them to,
who received a connnission for that pur-
pose. (Act. ii. Lib. 2. 0. 26. Lib. 4. 0. 42.)
‘ Asportare,’ says Klotz, is ‘to carry off,'
not for any particular purpose, but simply
‘ to carry away? So far the explanation is
true ; but the word seems to mean by
implication here, to carry away with the
intention of suppressing. Itis used again,
Act. ii. Lib. 2. c. 363 Lib. 3. c. 123 Lib. 4«.
c. 41.

scribam] A ‘scriba' is a public clerk
or writer, such as were employed in keep-
ing the public account-s and copying. See

what Cicero says of them, Act. ii. Lib. 3.
c. ¹78, 79. The body of ‘Scribae’ was
numerous, and had considerable influence
at Rome, as they were employed in all
branc-hes of administration. They were
divided into Decuriae, a kind of associa-
tions or corporatious. The various magis-
trateS, such as quaestors, aediles, and so
forth, had Scribae attached to them.

10. Queritur, effren] The cultivators
(aratores) besides paying their tenths were
required to furnish a certain quantity of
grain for the praetor’s use, for his ‘ cella'
or storehousc (see-De Sen. 0. 16, for the
general usc of ‘ cella ') 3 but he took money
instead, and when wheat was two sestertii
the modius, he made them pay him twelve.
(See Act. ii. Lib. 2. 0. 60,· Lib. 3. 0. 81.)
Cicero has already urged several reasons
against the fitness of Caecilius to be the
accuser, which have not much weight, and
this is wcaker than the rest. It is true
that he charges Caecilius with doing the
sanic thing that Verres did, but he does
not come to particulars.

‘ Frumentum imperare ' means to impose
on them a requisition. Sec Caesar, B. G.
vi. 4. As to ‘ Ai·zitoi·c.‘<,' sec Lib. iii.
