298 IN O. VERREM

IV. Quid illa quae leviora videntur esse, non cujusvis animum
possunt movere, quod ad tuam ipsius amicitiam ceterorumque
hominum magnorum atque nobilium faciliorem aditum istius habet
nequitia et audacia quam cujusquam nostrum virtus et integritas Ρ
Odistis hominum novorum industriam3 despicitis eorum frugali-
tatem3 pudorem contemnitis3 ingenium vero et virtutem depressam
extinctamque cupitis. Verrem amatis. Ita credo: si non virtute, »
11011 industria, non innocentia, non pudore, non pudicitia3 at ser-
mone, at literis, at humanitate ejus delectamini. Nihil eorum est,
contraque sunt omnia cum summo dedecore ac turpitudine, tum
singulari stultitia atque inhumanitate oblita. Huic homini si cujus
domus patet, utrum ea patere an hiare ac poscere aliquid videtur?

one of the all, who hate Verres, imposes
on himself even more than his share of the
burden of punishing this scouudrel. Every
Roman, every man, must hate him, for he
has injured every body (contra omnium bo-
norum rem, &c.). It is the duty of all to
punish him ; and Cicero imposes on himself
more than his share of this duty. We may
now see why, aster beginning in the earlier
part of this chapter with his own personal
dislike of Verres, he then makes all other
persons of the same mind as himself (qui
doleat, &c.). ‘ Pars virilis ³ is well ex-
plained by Forcellini, as usual. The law
writers make the matter still plainer. Pau-
lus (Recep. Sent. iii. tit. 2) sayS, “ si unius
patroni duo sint liberi, alterius quatuor,
singuli viriles, id est, aequales portiones
habebunt.”

4. nostrum . . hominum novorum] Cicero
is here showing his soreness at the con-
tempt with which the old ‘ nobiles ' looked
on the ‘novi homines‚' of whom he was
one. (See Pro Cluentio, 0. 40.) The
speech of Marius (Sallust, Jug. 63) may
serve as a comment on this passage. The
precise signification of the term ‘novus
homo' is well explained by W. A. Becker,
in his excellent work, “ Handbuch der
Rom. Alterthiimer '³ (2ΕΓ Τ11. lste Abth. p.
225): “he who was the first man of his
family to obtain a ‘curule' magistracy,
was, as Cicero says, ‘princeps nobilitatis?
or ‘ auctor generis ,³ that is, with him
begins the ‘nobilitas' of his family. He
is the first who has the ‘ jus imaginis ad
posteritatis memoriam prodendae ² (Cic.
Pro Rab. Post. c. 75 Verr. v. 14); but he
has 110 ‘imagines’ himself, not even ‘suam,'
as it is often incorrectly said 3 for it is na-
tural and certain that his bust would not
be set up until after his death (Polyb. vi.

53). He is not yet ‘nobilis' in the full
sense ς it is a ‘ nova nobilitas ς’ 110 himself
is and is called ‘homo novus,' and thus
‘novitas' is placed between ‘ignobilitas'
and ‘ nobflitas! From this it follows that
a patriciali could never be a ‘homo novus,’
but only a plebeian, and that L. Sextius,
the first plebeian consul, was also the first
‘ homo novus ' (Liv. vii. 1).”

at sermone, effa] See Lib. 1. 0. 37.

humanitate] Gellius· (xiv. 16) says ι
“ humanitatem appellaverunt id propemo-
dum quod Graeci παιδείαν vocant 3 1105 eru-
ditionem institutionemque in bonas artes
dicimus : quas qui sinceriter cupiunt appe-
tuntque, hi sunt vel maxime humanissimi,
810. Sic igitur eo verbo vel veteres esse
usos et cumprimis M. Varronem Marcum-
que Tullium omnes ferme libri declarant.”
The juxtaposition of ‘literis ³ assists the
explanation of ‘ humanitas? In the letter
Ad Q. Fr. i. 1. c. 9, Cicero says of the in-
habitants of the province of Asia : “ quum
vero ei generi hominum praesimus‚ non
modo in quo ipsa sit sed etiam a quo ad
alios pervenisse putetur humanitas‚” where
the word has the same sense as 111 this pas-
sage. But there are passages 111 which it
seems to be used in the wider sense of the
general feeling of good-will to others,
which is one of the characteristics of men
as distinguished from brutcs ε “ tametsi
nullus in te sensus humanitatis, nulla ratio
unquam fuit religionis? Lib. 1. c. 18 3 and
in De Am. c. 13 ε “ Quamobrem si cadit in
sapientem animi dolor, qui profecto cadit,
nisi ex ejus animo extirpatam humanitatem
arbitramur,” where the word means the
natural feelings and affections generally.

poscere aliquid] As if every noble's
house were gaping for what it could get
from Verres to put into its mouth.
