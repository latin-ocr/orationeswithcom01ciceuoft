186 EDICTA MAGISTRATUUM.

The Edicta of the Magistratus in course of time formed a considerable
body of Law, on which we have the commcnts of the J urists contained
in the ‘excerpta’ in Justinian’s Digest. That body of Edictal Law
which was framed by the Praetors was called Praetorium Jus3 and that
which was formed by the Edict of the Curnle Aediles, Aedilicium JuS.
The term J us Honorarium comprehends both, as the term Honorarium
expresses the honor (office) of the Magistratus3 though J us Honorarium
is generally used as equivalent to Praetorium J us. This Honorarium χ
Jus is a part of the Jus Civile Romanorum, or the peculiar law of Rome,
for it was formed by Roman Magistratus3 it was generally applicable
only to Roman institutions and Roman usageS, and perhaps originally
contained only pure rules of Roman law. But Honorarium J us may
also be viewed as opposed to J us Civile⁹ (the two forming the two great
divisions of the whole matter of Roman law), when we look at the
Honorarium J us with reference to its origin in the office of the Magistratus.
The Leges and Plebiscita were direct sources of law. ‘⁶ The Praetor on
the contrary did not declare in his Edictum what should henceforth be
law, to do which he had no authority; but he declared what he would
consider and treat as law, so that he merely gave notice of what he should
do during his year of office. Accordingly those rules of law which were
truly rules of law, were said to exist ‘ipso jure,' while the Praetor's
rules were said to exist ‘ jurisdictione, tuitione Praetoris’ '’ (Savigny,
System des Heutiyen Ro'mz'schen Rechts, i. 117). The Romans formed a
clear distinction between the rights which a man had by the strict Jus
Civile, to which rights, when they were disputed or infringed, it was the
Praetor-'s duty to give effect3 and the rights which he derived simply
from the Praetor's Edictum: and this distinction is often expressed in
the clearest ternis. The Praetor by virtue of his office had the power of
giving effect as fully to the rights which were founded on his Edictum,
as to the rights which were founded on the strict Jus Civile.

Those who are accustomed to look only to the direct sources of law,
to statutes (leges), and who found their narrow notion of law on the
definition of a Lex, may have some difficulty in comprehending the
Roman system. But we know that a very large part of the Roman
law, that which is of most extensive application, was founded on the
Edictum, and developed by the Roman jurists. The system in brief
was this. There was no continuous and ever active direct legislation
among the Romans as to that part of the law which comprehended
Privatum Jus. The changes which were from time to time wanted,
were made through the organ of an office which was accessible to most
of the citizens, and filled by a different person every year. This person,

9 J us Civile had several meaning-s. See the Article J m, Dict. of Antiqs.
