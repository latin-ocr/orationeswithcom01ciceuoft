I take it to be, the text must stand as 1
have it.

demendo, mutanclo,] Orelli inserts in
brackets, after ¹ mutando,⁵ the words ‘ cu-
rando ne litura appareat,' which is 111 the
old texts. But this passage was read by
N onius Marcellus, quoted by Zumpt, as it
stands in the text 3 and the words ‘ curando
ne litura appareat ' are wanting in Lg. 29.

Ejusmodi [sub]sortitionem] The text
stands as it does in Klotz, who adds ‘ suae '
after ‘quaestionis,’ which word ‘suae' Ι
have placed in brackets. He also omits
the words [erepta. . . eorum]- Q. Curtius is
evidently the ‘judex’ of some other ‘ quaes-
tio? and not of this, as Asconius supposes5
but the word ‘suae ’ does not for that reason
seem necessary. The reading of Klotz is
founded on V, which has ‘ suae.' He
*translates the whole passage thus : ‘ such a
choice by lot the senseless fellow thought
that he could accomplish through 1115 00111-
rade, Q. Curtius, the presiding judge of his
(that is, his own) court of inquiry ‚- since,
if Ι had not opposed him with the power
of the people, and the shouts and eries of
the many, he would have taken by lot
from the Decuria, in which I ought to have
the utmost freedom (of choice), those whom
Verres indicated to him, into his own Con-
silium, without any (sufficient) reason?
The expression ‘ quos annuerat ' 15 not
conformable to the usage of ‘ annuere.’ The
passage is very difficult, and apparently
corrupted. The reading of Klotz is not
altogether satisfactory5⁵li11t Ι 0311 prsopo 50
nothing better. Iordaii has the same as
Klotz.

Zumpt reads, at the beginning of the
sentence, ‘ Ejusmodi sortitionem? The
‘ lemma’ of Asconius has ‘ subsortitionem ;'
and he adds, “obscurus 100115, 50(1, ut opinor,
sensus hic est ,³³ and he then proceeds to
explain it. His explanation requires ‘sub-
sortitionem ;’ and if we reject it, which we
must do, there is no reason why we should
not adopt ‘ ejusmodi sortitionem‚’ and refer
it to the original choosing by lot, and not
to the supplying by lot the places of
those who were rejected. Zumpt retains
the words ‘erepta esset facultas eoru1n‚'

Ejusmodi [sub]sortitionem homo amentissimus

If‘ nam though they are not in V. Klotz thinks that
.fuisse' is the rem* ‘uk of Verres, as they may be a gloss3 but, if these 11 ords

are retained, it is necessary to add some-
thing after‘ eprum quos3 'and Zumpt has
added‘quun1.'

This Curtius is probably the Q. Postu
mins Curtius mentioned' 111 0. 39. He was
a ‘judex qiiaesti01iiS‚’ but notin this case of
Verres, for Glabrio presided. Being a ‘ju-
dex quaestionis’ in another case, he at-
tempted to help Verres, by getting the ‘ju-
dices' for the case before him, his own case,
out of the ‘decu1·ia,' which was to supply
the ‘judices' for the trial of Verres3 and
getting them before the ‘consilium' was
formed for the trial of Verres. His object
was to get the honest men away, and leave
the rogues for the ‘ consilium ' of Verres.

Madvig has explained this matter of the
‘judex quaestionis,' and Zumpt has given a
summ-ary of his explanation. The expres-
sion ‘judex quaestionis' is only used by
Cicero, and in two other passages (Dig. cis.
8. 1 ; and Collatio Legum Mosaicarum et
Romanarum, 1. 3), both of which passages
refer to the Lex Cornelia de Sicariis. There
is an inscription in which C. Octavius, the
father of Augustus, is named J udex Quaes-
tionum. (See also In Vatin. e. 14, note on
QuaesitoreS, vol. iv.) The praetor did not
preside in those cases where there was a
‘judex quaestionis? Before the time of
Sulla, 5010131 ‘quaestiones' had been esta-
blis hed (s ee the Excursus, De Repetundis),
and, as Ferracci thinks, more than four.
Τ11010 were then six pr aetors, one of whom
was the Praetor Urbanus, and another the
Praetor Peregrinus If there were not
praetors enough for all the ⁴ quaestiones,'
the easiest way of supplying presidents,
without making more ‘magistratusj was
to appoint ‘judices quaestionum’ to pre-
side in particular cases. Sulla increased
the number of praetors to eight3 but the
‘quaestiones' also were ir creased in his time
to the number of eight, or even nine, as
some suppose. The number of pr aetors,
