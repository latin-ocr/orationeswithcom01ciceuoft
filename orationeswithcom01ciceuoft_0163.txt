AOT. II. LIBER PRIMUS. 145
plinam tradite. Mirum est hominis ingenium, mira prudentia.
ι Minucius quidam mortuus est ante istum praetorem: ejus testa-
mentum erat nullum: lege hereditas ad gentem Minuciam veniebat.
Si habuisset iste edictum, quod ante istum et postea omnes habu-
erunt, possessio Minuciae genti esset data: si quis testamento se
heredem esse arbitraretur quod tum non exstaret, lege ageret in
hereditatem3 aut pro praede litis vindiciarum quum satis accepisset, ²
sponsionem faceret3 ita de hereditate certaret. Hoc, opinor, jure
et majores nostri et nos semper usi sumus. Videte ut hoc iste cor-
rexerit. Componit edictum iis verbis ut quivis intelligere possit
unius hominis causa conscriptum esse, tantum quod hominem non
nominat; causam quidem totam perscribit3 jus, consuetudinem,

prudentia] means ironically ‘juris pru-
dentia.'

leffe hereditas] Lex, used thus abso-
lutely, means the Lex Duodecim Tabula-
rum, which, if there were no ⁵ sui heredes,j
gave the ‘hereditas ³ to the ‘ agnati 3' and,
if there were 110 ‘agnati,' the ‘lex’ gave
the ‘hereditas ' to the ⁵ gentiles,' which is
the case that Cicero puts here (Gaius, iii.
§ 173 Cicero, De Or. i. 39). If Verres
had adopted 111 his ‘edictum ¹ (habuisset)
that rule of law which all praetors, both
before him and since, have adopted, 110
would have given the ‘possessio' to the
‘gens' The Gentilicium J us, which was
in force in the time of Cicero, had fallen
into desuetude in the time of the Antonini,
when Gaius wrote, “ totum gentilicium jus
in desuetudinem abiisse.” As to ‘gens’
and ‘gentiles,’ see Dict. of Antiqs„ ‘ Gens?

[eye ageret] In the time of Gaius there
were three forms of procedure 111 1150 where

either the ownership of a thing was claimed :-

or an ‘ hereditas? These three forms were

the ‘ Sacramenti legis actio: and the twoa

forms of procedure ‘per fimuulas? The
‘Sacramenti legis aetio' 15 expressed 111
this passage of Cicero by the words ‘lege
ageret,' and this form of action was before
thc court of the Centumviri. The other
somn by which a man proceeded in Cicero's
timc 111 the case of an ‘hereditas’ was
‘per sponsionem‚’ and that also is men-
tioned here. 'l'he third form by tho ‘ for-
mula petitoria’ was also known to Cicero,
but it was only used 111 1115 time where the
ownership of a thing, not an *111-1011111153
was in question. Gaius describes the two
methods ‘per fornmlas' in the following
ternis.

If any man thought that 110 was entitled
to the ownership of a thing 01· to au ‘ here-

ditas,' he could either sue directly by the
‘formula petitoria,' in which case there
must be a ‘ stipulatio judicatum solvi ' 011
the part of the defendant in possession, by
way of ‘ satisdatio,' or security, to the
plaintiff5 or the plaintiff would proceed by
the ‘SPQiQ' and there would bc, on the
part of the defendant in possession, a ‘pro ι
praede litis et vindiciarum stipulatio,³ which ⁶·
would be a security for the value of the
thing (lis), the ownership of which was 111
dispute, and for the ‘ mesne ' (intermediate)
profits (vindiciae), as Gaius explains it (iv.
ξ 91, &c.). The complete expression 15
‘pro praede litis et vindiciarum ς’ but
Cicero's omission of ‘ets in which 110 is
followed by Asconius, is conformable to
Roman usage, as in the expression, ‘ Patres
Conseripti,’ ‘ usus fructus,’ and others.
Gaius says (iv. 91), “ 11100 autem appellata.
est pro praede litis vindiciarum stipulatio,
qnia in locum praedium successit, qui olim,
cum lege agebatur, pro lite et vindiciis, id
est pro re et fructibus a possessore petitori
(lal)ant111·.” on-dan says, “ Gaius in hae
formula semper habet litis et vind? But
the ‘ ct ’ 15 omitted iu this passage of Gaius,
and Savigny infers that ‘ ct ’ is au interpola-
tion. (See Savigny, System, ἂψ, v. ξ 209;
aud Beilagc ix. ; and also Vermiseht.
Schriften, 1. p. 308.)

In the ‘formula petitoria‚' the plaintifi''s
claim (intentio) to the thing was expressed,
as in Aet. ii. Lib. 2. c. 12. ln the ‘ sponsi0,’
the form of ‘stipulatio' was this, “ Si 11111110
quo de agitur ex jure Quiritium meus est,
sestertios cxxv nummos dare spon‹les?''
And, with 1010101100 tothis ⁸ sti1›ul·.1ti0,· the
‘ intentio' of the formula. was, ‘¹ si paret
N. N. A. Α. SS. cxxv. nummos dare opor-
tere.'' (Excursus v.)
