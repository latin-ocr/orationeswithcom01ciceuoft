etiam Stesichori poetae statua senilis, incurva, cum libro, summo,

“neque interest, quomodo dicatur, utrum
de Scipionis voluntate an simpliciter nar-
randi causa ;’' which does not seem aclear
form of expression, though the meaning
may be right.

Himera deleta,] Himera, on the north
coast of Sicily, near the mouth of the river
Himera, was founded by Chalcidians from
Zancle or Messana (B.c. 649). But geo-
graphers are not agreed about the site of
this ancient city. Probably about B.c.
476, after a great civil commotion, it re-
ceived a large accession of citizens Dorians
and others, from Theron, tyrant of Acragas
(Agrigentum), and became a very 1101111511-
ing place. In Β. c. 408 it was destroyed
by0 the Carthaginians, and never rebuilt
(Diodorus, xi. 49). After the destruction of
the city, the Carthaginians founded a new
city at the hot springs (Thermae) m the
neighbourhood, on the east side of the
river ; but the name of the former city was
also retained, for the place was called Ther-
mae Himeraeae (Polyb. i. 24). There is
also an inscription: iinrmtssoavn 'rm-:n-
Ml'r. The figure of a female, the symbol
of Himera, appears on some of the coins of
this city. A 00111 of the Principe of Torre-
muzza exhibits on one side Himera, the
goddess of the river and the city, witha
veil 011 the back part of the head, and with
a mural crown 3 behind the head is a cornu-
copia. On the other side is the bald-
headcd, stooping old man, Stesichorus,
resting on a strong staff, and reading in a
roll. The inscription is ΘΕΡΜΙΤΩΝ ΙΜΕ-
ΡΑΙΩΝ. visconti, Iconographie Grccque,
quoted by Creuzer and Moser. Garatoni,
quoted by Iordan, refers to Castelli, Num.
Sic. p. 33, 111111 adds a remark useful for
those to whom it is new : “ Nam typi nu-
mismatum statuas imitabantur, si quae in
urbibus esseut artificio praestantes, tuni
conditorum, tum civium clarorum, tum
deorum ct fluminum, (1110111111 011111111111
effigies placebat insculpere.'' Τ110 modern
name of Thermae is Termini. “ The 0111115-

beate sulphureous spring raises Fahren-
heit’s thermometer to 1210.” Smyth's

Sicily, p. 95.
eximia pulchritudine] Orelli has ‘mira
pulchritudine? V has ‘ pulcritudine,' but

in the preceding chapter ‘pulcherrima’
This is probably one of the numerous
words, the orthography of which was un-
settled in Cicero’s time, as appears from
the passage Orat. c. 48: “Quin ego ipse
quum scirem ita majores locutos esse ut
nusquam nisi in vocali adspiratione ute-
rentur, loquebar sic, ut pulcros, Cetegos,
triecmpos, Cartaginem dicerem: aliquando
idque sero convicio aurium quum extorta
mihi veritas esset, usum loquendi populo
concessi, scientiam mihi rcservavi.''

Stesichori] One of the oldest Greek
lyric poetS, was born some time in the
sevcnth century 110, 111 Sicily, but the
place of his birth is not stated. Stesi-
chorus lived at Himera some. part os his
life, as Cicero says, and Pausanias (iii.
19): but it is uncertain if it was 1115 birth-
place.

The words ‘ab eo ’ make a difficulty. It
is clear, as Klotz observes, that they are not-
to be connected with ‘ factast for ’ qui suit'
undoubtedly refers to Stesichorus. Cicero
means to connect Stesichorus with Himera
in some way, but there 15 probably some
corruption' m the text. Klotz finds no dif-
ficulty' 111 explaining‘ ab eo: ”()110111 51155,
according to a Latin form of express 1011,
used in common life, the more particular
explanation of 55111011 we naturally cannot
here enter upon—I mean that Stesichorus
who residcd at Himera,'' &cu Zumpt omits
the words ‘ ab e0,' though it seems that the
MSS„ except N φ, have them. There
seems no way of explaining ’1111 eo.’ The
attempt of Klotz is ridiculous. Τ110 words
’(1111 fuit’ 500111 111 themselves insuffi-
cient, · wc want something more positive, ·
and this 55111111 15 55 31110511 <wius to 110 111 the
