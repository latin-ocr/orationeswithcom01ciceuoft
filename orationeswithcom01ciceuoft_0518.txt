500 IN O. VERREM

satis lato a Sicilia mari periculosoque disjuncta, in qua est eodem
nomineffippidum quo iste nunquam accessit3 quod tamen isti tex—
trinum per triennium ad muliebrem vestem conficiendam fuit. Ab
eo⁵”oppido non longe in promontorio fanum est J unonis antiquum,
quod tanta religione semper fuit ut non modo illis Punicis bellis,
quae in his fere locis navali copia gesta atque versata sunt, sed
etiam hac praedonum multitudine semper inviolatum sanctumque
fuerit. Quin etiam hoc memoriae prodi-tum est, classe quondam
Masinissae regis ad eum locum appulsa praefectum regium dentes
eburneos incredibili magnitudine e fano sustulisse, et eos in Africam
port-asse Masinissaeque donasse. Regem primo delectatum esse
munere; post ubi audisset unde essent, statim certos homines in
quinqueremi misisse qui eos dentes reponerent. *Itaque in his
scriptum literis Punicis fuit, Regem Masinissam imprudentem
accepisse, re cognita reportandos curasse. Erat praeterea ”magna
vis eboris, multa ornamenta, in quibus eburneae Victoriae antiquo
opere ac summa arte perfectae. Haec iste omnia, ne multis mor—er,
uno impetu atque uno nuntio per servos venereos, quos ejus rei
causa miserat, tollenda atque asportanda curavit.

XLVII. Pro dii immortales, quem ego hominem accuso, quem
legibus aut judiciali jure persequor, de quo vos sententiam per

veral good harbours3 the inhabitants are
rich, for it contains all kinds of artizans,
but the best are those who make linen eloth
(ὀθόνια), which is remarkable for fineness
and softness. The direct distance from
Syracuse to the nearest point of Malta is
about ninety English miles. Diodorus adds
that the island was settled by the Phoeni·
cians, who brought with them the useful
arts from their native country. Tyre was
noted for its manufactures. Ezekicl (xxvii.
’7) speaks of “fine linen with broidercd work
from Egypt‚’' and of the Syrian merchants
(V. 16) : “ they occupied 111 thy fairs with
emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and
fine linen, and coral, and agate.’' This
seems somewhat ambiguous in the English
version. But we may conclude that the
Tyrians became skilled in many of the arts,
and carried them into their colonies.
Greeks also settled in Malta, which we
infer from the fact of Greek inscriptions
having been found in Malta and coins with
the Greek legend MEAITAIoN.

promontorio] “ ‘ promunturio ' R, ‘ pro-
muntorio ³ Lg. 29 et 5 alii³³ (Iordan). See
Cacsar, B. G. iii. 12, and the note, ed.
Long. In Ι. Vossius’ edition of Mela, i.
19, the word is written ‘ promuntoria.'

hac praedonum] Cicero contrasts the
robberies of the pirateS, who scoured the
Mediterranean in his time, with the state
of affairs in the now somewhat remote pe-
riod of the Punic wars (illis). He alludcs
to the ‘piratae ³ in the following chapter.
R Ld. Iordan have ‘hac' instead of ‘in
hac‚' the former reading. This ablative
denotes a state or condition of things.
Compare Caesar, B. G. i. 18, ‘imperio
populi Romani,' and ii. 12, ‘ summaque erat
vasto atque aperto mari . . . difficultas na-
vigandi.'

certos homines] ‘ Sure, trusty men,' as
Graevius rightly explains it.

eburneae] Ivory was one of the articles
of commcrce which reached Tyre (Ezekiel,
xxvii. 15), and it was 110 doubt used as a
material for the skill of the carver, and to
decorate articles of furniture. There were
probably small figures carved in ivory, a
braneh of art in which we see 111 modern
times some excellent specimens. The co-
lossal statue of Ceres (c. 49) held in the
hand a figure of Victory. We often see
such representations on coins.

47. judiciali jure] Lambinus found a
difficulty in ‘judiciali,' and he proposed to
omit it, or to transpose the word and make
