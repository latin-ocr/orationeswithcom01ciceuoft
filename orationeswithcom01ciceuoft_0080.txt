deum (lenique nullum Siculis qui ei paulo magis affabre atque antiquo
artificio factus videretur reliquit. In stupris vero et flagitiis nefa-
rias ejus libidines commemorare pudore deterreor3 simul illorum
calamitatem commemorando augere nolo, quibus liberos conjuges-
que suas integras ab istius petulantia conservare non licitum est.
At enim haec ita commissa sunt ab isto ut non cognita sint ab
hominibus. Hominem esse arbitror neminem qui nomen istius audi-
erit quin facta quoque ejus nefaria commemorare possit, ut mihi'
magis timendum sit ne multa crimina praetermittere quam ne qua
in istum fingere existimer. Neque enim mihi videtur haec multi-
tudo quae ad audiendum convenit cognoscere ex me causam voluisse,
sed ea quae scit 1116011111 recognoscere.

VI. Quae quum ita sint, iste homo amens ac perditus alia mecum
ratione pugnat. Non id agit ut alicujus eloquentiam mihi opponat;
non gratia, non auctoritate cujusquam, non potentia nititur. Simu-
lat his se rebus confidere3 sed video quid. agat, neque enim agit
occultissime; proponit inania mihi nobilitatis, hoc est hominum
arrogantium nomina, qui non tam me impediunt quod nobiles sunt
quam adjuvant quod noti sunt. Simulat se eorum praesidio con-
fidere, quum interea aliud quiddam jam diu machinetur. Quam

consideration of a thing which is known.

liberos] This comprehensive term must
6. Quae quum ita sint‚] One of Cicero’ S

be here limited to ‘dauglite1·s,’ as Klotz

remarks, for Verres is no where charged
with unnatural passion&

At enim] ‘ But, it may be said, all this
he has done in such wise as not to be knovm
to people.' Cicero has given, in general
terms, a catalogue of the enormities of
Verres, enough, if true, to cover him with
infamy. To anticipate an objection, that he
ought to be more particular in his state-
ments, for all these crimes could not be
known to every body, he adds what follows,
‘ Hominem esse,' &c The reading ⁶ homi-
nibus' is only in Lg. 29, but Halm says
that he thinks it is the true reading, and I
think he is right. The other Mss.l1m·e
‘ omnibus ς’ but there is little force in say-
ing that they were not known to every
body. ‘Hominibus' and ‘omnibus’ are
often confounded. Lg. 29 has also ‘ar-
bitror esse neminem.5 But the repetition
of the word gives more force to the pas-
sage, and the position of ‘hominem’ is a
reason for preferring ‘ hominibus?

reeofflroscere] ‘ Cognoscere ex me cau-
sam ' means ‘ to be informed of the facts of
the case by me.' ‘Recognoscere,' as he
explains it by ‘ ea quae seit: means a fresh

usual formulae, aud hardly worth notice,
except to show that ‘ita ' is generally a
word of reference, like ‘ is,' to what has
preceded.

proponit inania . . . nohilitatis‚] The ge-
nerality of Roman ternis is one of the great
difficulties of the language, which some-
times makes it almost impossible to trans-
late. ‘ While he is really doing one thing?
says Cicero, ‘he attempts to deceive me by
the show of another thing? ‘ To divert my
attention, he puts before me the unsub-
stantials of nobility, that is, the names of
arrogant men? He appears not to mean
by ‘inania,' that ‘ nobilitas‚³ or the eondi-
tion of being ‘ nobilis,' was a ‘ res inanis 3'
but these names of his noble defenders were
unsubstantial things, the real substance of
his defenee being his command of money to
bribe with. A ‘ nobilis,' in the time of
Cicero, was a man whose father or ancestors
had cnjoyed a Curule office. A plebeian,
who was the first member of his family who
attained a Curule office, also became ‘ no-
bilis‚' and was the founder of the ‘nobilitas'
of his family. See Act. ii. 3. 0. 4, note on
‘ novus homo.’
