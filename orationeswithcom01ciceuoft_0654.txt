SICILY A ROMAN PROVINCE.

Ι snALL here attempt to explain briefly the condition of Sicily as a
Roman province in the time of Cicero.

Hiero IL, king of Syracuse, the friend and the ally of the Romans,
died about nc. 216, leaving that part of the island which was under his
government well organized in its civil administration. He was suc·
ceeded by a youth, his grandson Hieronymus, who deserted the Roman
for the Carthaginian alliance. Hieronymus was murdered in Rc. 215,
and in the next year the Roman senate sent the consul Μ. Claudius
Marcellus to Sicily, who laid siege to Syracuse, and took the city nc.
212. Marcellus remained in Sicily until the following year3 and though
he did not terminate the warin the island, he did something towards
the settlement of affairs. Scipio Africanus was in Sicily as consul Rc.
205, and as proconsul in B.c. 2043 and it appears from Cicero that he
had time to do something towards settling the island. He regulated for
the Agrigentini the mode of filling up vacancies in their senate (Lib. 2,
c. 50), as Rupilius afterwards did for Heraclia. Cicero speaks of these
‘leges ' of Scipio as ‘ antiquae ;’ and it appears from the chapter referred
to, that he means the elder Africanus. He informs us in another place
(Lib. 2. c. 23 Lib. 4. c. 33, ὥσ.) that P. Africanus (the younger), after
the destruction of Carthage Bc. 146, was in Sicily, and that he restored
to the Sicilians all the works of art which the Carthaginians had carried
off, and which fell into the hands of the Romans on the capture of Car-
thage. Though Sicily had for some time been a Roman province, the
administration does not appear to have been finally settled until B.O. 131,
when the proconsul P. Rupilius, after suppressing the revolt of the
slaves, and with the assistance of ten commissioners appointed by the
senate, made those regulations which subsisted at the time when Cicero
delivered his orations against Verres (Lib. 2. c. 13). The rcgulations
of Rupilius were called the Lex Rupilia.

The condition of Sicily and of its towns undcr the Roman government
was not uniform, but the difference had mainly, though not entirely,
reference to taxation. The Sicilian towns had a senate, and a com-
monalty or body of citizens, who had still some power3 for Cicero,
