AOT. II. LIBER QUARTUS. 507

cunque accidant publice privatimque incommoda propter eam
causam sceleris istius evenire videantur. Audistis Centuripinos,
Agyrinenses, catinenses, Aetnenses, Herbitenses, compluresque
alios publice dicere, quae solitudo in agris esset, quae vastitas, quae
fuga aratorum, quam deserta, quam inculta, quam relicta omnia.
Ea tametsi multis istius et variis injuriis acciderunt, tamen haec
una causa in opinione Siculorum plurimum valet, quod Cerere
violata omnes cultus fructusque Cereris in his locis inte-risse arbi-
trantur. Medemini religioni sociorum, judices: conservate ves-
tram. Neque enim haec externa vobis est religio neque aliena.
Quod si esset, si suscipere eam nolletis, tamen in eo qui violasset
sancire vos velle oporteret. Nunc vero in communi omnium gen-
tium religione, inque his sacris, quae majores nostri ab exteris
nationibus ascita atque arcessita coluerunt, quae sacra, ut erant re
vera, sic appellari Graeca voluerunt, negligentes ac dissoluti, si

nation does not distinguish superstition ‘propter eam causam scelere istius? There

from religion 3 for the distinction implies a
cultivated understanding andan exereise of
the reason. Those who distinguish super-
stition and religion may call the religion of
those who do not make the distinction by
the name of superstition; but they cannot
properly call thc religion of those who do
make the distinction by the name of super-
stition. ch cannot translate the Latin
word ‘ religio ³ by the English word ‘ super-
stition,’ even if we think that the Roman
‘ religio ' was superstition. Lucretius may
have used ‘ religio ’ as we would use super-
stition now, when he said (i. 63) :

“ Humana ante oculos fede quum vita
jaceret
In terris oppressa gravi sub religione ;”

for he made no distinction between religion
and superstition.

publice privatimque] In his minor edi-
tion Zumpt has ‘publice vel privatim,'
which is the common reading. The objec-
tion to it is that a single ‘ vel ' is not used
in this manner by Cicero, but is used for
the purpose os giving more emphasis to ιι
word, οι· with the addition of ¹ potius, ' or

‘die nn, ''01 ἰ’-υιὶιιυ1 dic· ·ιιιι, 'for the pm po c
of correctiug something that has been said,
or st mn„ it moie explieitls (Zumpt).

piopter eam eausam a] 'lhc common
leading, sa3s Zumpt, thcrto hus been

is obviously something wrong in this, and
it has been proposed to omit ‘ scelere istius,’
or to omit ‘propter eam causam? But
the reading in the text removes all diffi-
culty, and has the authority of R 3, λ. The
literal translation is ‘on account of that
matter of his wiekedness,‘ but the meaning
is ‘ through his crime, which is the cause?
This use of ‘causa’ with a genitive is de-
fended by Zumpt and Madvig ; bnt it needs
no defence, for those who have read Latin
authors with care ma3' tind plenty of ex-
amples. In Lib. 5. e. 9 theie is ‘sinc
causa quaestus: which 1111=1111s‘11111i·›‘s··l1t
had the motive or object ot* gain; ’gthou h
the word ‘causa “ has not the same sense
as here. ln this last passage ‘causa' de-
notes the end or object of an aet, a thing
future. llere it refers toa thing past, as
the antecedent os another thing. The word
ha< both these senses in legal langnage, and
is explained b3· Futerholmwr, Lehre des
