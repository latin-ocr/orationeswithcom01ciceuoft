460 IN O. VERREM

hunc praetorem in provincia quisquam putabit a Siculorum argento
cupiditatem aut manus abstinere potuisse? 7

XVI. Verum uti Lilybaeum unde digressa est oratio revertatur,
Diocles est, Pamphili gener illius, a quo hydria ablata est, Popillius
cognomine. Ab hoc abaci vasa omnia ut exposita fuerant abstulit.
Dicat se licet emisse: etenim hic propter magnitudinem furti sunt,
ut opinor, literae factae. J ussit Timarchidem aestimare argentum.
Quo modo? Quo qui unquam tenuissime in donatione[m] histrio-
num aestimavit.) Tametsi jamdudum ego erro qui tam multa de
tuis emptionibus verba faciam, et quaeram utrum emeris necne, et
quomodo et quanti emeris; quod verbo transigere possum. Ede

16. oratio revertatum] The reading of
the English reprint of Zumpt, and, 1 sup-
pose, of his minor edition. In his larger
he has ‘ oratio, revertamur? ‘ Revertamur
G 3, codd. Lamb.: rei-ertantur R 3 reverta-
tur, dett ' (Iordan, who 1135 ‘ revertamur ³).

abaci] An ‘ abacus' is a board, or slab
of marble, or any thing of the kind on
which plate could be arranged, as we often
put it on 3 sideboard. Verres took it all
off, just as it was laid out 011 the ‘ abacus.'
See Lib. 4. 0. 59, ‘mensas Delphicas,³ and
Juv. iii. 204, ‘ ornamentum abaci.'

exposita fuerant] ‘exposita fuerunt '
Klotz, Iordan.

literae factae] Entries were made 3
that is, the transaction was entered in
account-books in the usual way.

in donatione[m] histrionum] ‘in dona-
tionem ’ Klotz, Iordan. Iordan says ‘in
donatione,' dett. I suppose we must con-
clude that the ‘meliores' have ‘in dona-
tionem? Cicero says that Timarchides
valned the things very low, as low as any
man ever did in the case of a donation
or present to the ‘histriones' or actors.
Zumpt’s explanation is this, that they were
allowed to keep the ‘ corollae ³ which they
had worn (deornm honoris causa), 011 pay-
ing a small estimated value. He refers to
Pliny (H. N„ Lib. 21. c. 3) as to these
‘ corollae 3' and Klotz says it appears that
a present of fixed value was given to the
actors who were approved of 3 and, if it
was intended to give more, the present
was valued below its real value, to avoid
breaking the rule. This explanation, I
believe, is merely a guess3 there is nothing
added to give credibility to it. I neither
accept it nor reject it. There is a short
note on ‘ corollarium' (Plin. H. N. ix. 35,
ed. Hard.) : “ corollarium apud Ciceronem
non semel, et apud Tranquillum, pro mu-

nusculo sumitur, ultra legitima praemia
exhibito, et quidem quasi additamento de-
bitae mercedis. Unde corollarium 11ἀο
pro re leviore et appendicula usurpatur.’'
This does not help us much3 but the ex-
pression ‘ultra legitima praemia' may
point to the truth: ‘legitimus’ always
means that which is determined by a ‘lein'
Manutius says, “ Locus hic ostendit bonos
histriones argento donari solitos.’' I sup-
pose ‘ histriones ’ iu those days, as well as
now, did not live on nothing, nor act
simply to please spectators. They must
have been paid some way. Manutius adds,
“aestimationi tamen locum esse non vi-
deo 5³³ but Cicero did, and that is the
matter which wants explanation. There
may have been some rule of law as to
these ‘donationes' There is a remark in
Smyth's Sicily that strikes me as applica-
ble to these gifts or ‘ corollaria‚' for Ι be-
lieve that the ‘ corollaria’ 15 money. He
says of the Sieilian actors : “there is little
encouragement given to the profession,
and at their benefits they are obliged to
submit to the degrading habit of going
round and presenting a plate to each of
the spectators to receive a contributi0n’'
(p.‘48). I don't quote this for the pur-
pose of explaining the language of the
text ς Ι merely observe that the practice
of the spectators putting something in the
hat or plate for the ‘histriones ’ may have
existed at Rome, and that would be a ‘do-
natio.’ Halm quotes a passage from Varro
(de L. L. v. 178) : “ corollarium si (quid)
additum praeter quam quod debitum ejus,
vocabulum fictum a corollis, quod eae,
cum placuerant actores, in scena dare
solitae.” This agrees with Pliny (ix. 35).
Crassus Dives, as Pliny says (xxi. 0, 3),
was the first who gave ‘coronae' of gold
and silver at his Ludi.
