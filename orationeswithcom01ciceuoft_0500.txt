482 IN O. VERREM

ab Aenea fugiente a Troja atque in haec loca veniente conditum
esse demonstrant. Itaque Segestani non solum perpetua societate
atque amicitia verum etiam cognatione se cum populo Romano con-
junctos esse arbitrantur. Hoc quondam oppidum, quum illa civitas
cum Poenis suo nomine ac sua sponte bellaret, a Karthaginiensibus
vi captum atque deletum est, omniaque quae ornamento urbi esse
possent Karthaginem sunt ex 1110 1000 deportata. Fuit apud Seges-
tanos ex aere Dianae simulacrum, quum summa atque antiquissima
praeditum religione, tum singulari opere artificioque perfectum.
Hoc translatum Karthaginem locum tantum hominesque mutarat3
religionem quidem pristinam servabat, nam propter eximiam pul-
chritudinem etiam hostibus digna quam sanctissime colerent vide-
batur. Aliquot saeculis post P. Scipio bello Punico tertio Kartha-
ginem cepit3 qua in victoria—videte hominis virtutem et diligen-
tiam, ut et domesticis praeclarissimae virtutis exemplis gaudeatis
et eo majore odio dignam istius incredibilem audaciam judicetis—
convocatis Siculis omnibus, quod diutissime saepissimeque Siciliam
vexatam a Karthaginiensibus esse cognorat, jubet omnia conquiri:
pollicetur sibi magnae curae fore ut omnia civitatibus quae cujus-
que fuissent restituerentur. Tum illa quae quondam erant Himera

the siege of Troy, came to dwell near the
Egestaei, being driven by stress of weather
to Libya first, and thence to Sicily. It
was probably a motley population, in which
the Greek part at last prevailed.

The remains of Segesta are about six
miles from Castellamare, in the north-west
angle of Sicily. There is a Doric temple,
and vestiges of an ancient theatre. The
remains “ stand in a bleak, deserted, sterile
situation, to the eastward of the boundary
of the ancient city ; and the only resting-
place for the traveller is the shade of a
neighbouring tree, where there is a good
spring of fresh water 3 the scenery and
stillness, however, make it appear wild,
grand, and impressivc.'’ “ The temple is
somewhat peculiar, probably was never
finished, for the ‘ cella ’ is wanting 3 but it
is nearly entire'' (Smyth's Sicily, 671).
There are twelve Doric unfluted pillars on
each side, without reckoning those at the
angles; and six at each end, reckoning
those at the angles; thirty-six pillars in
all. Swinburne (Travels in the Two Sicilies,
ii. 232) gives the name of Barbara to the
site of Egesta. Castellamare was the
port of Egesta. Swinburne describes the
position of the city as very good, “ upon a
ridge of hills gently sloping towards the

northern aspect, sheltered on the southern
and eastern quarters by high rocky emi-
nences, at the foot of which two roaring
brooks winded their course, and embraced
the city.'' Swinburne describes plainly
and clearly what he sees. These two
brooks may be the Simois and Scamandrus
of Strabo (p. 608). Diodorus also (xx. 71)
mentions the Scamandrus. The united
stream flows to the sea at Castellamare.
The names Simois and Scamandrus remind
us of the rivers of the Troad‚ whence, ac-
cording to the tradition, the settlers of
Segesta came. There is a description of
the temple of Segesta in Goethe’s Ita-
lianische Reise.

captum atque deletum] The destruction
of Segesta by the Carthaginians is not
mentioned elsewhere3 and, if there is no
evidence except this passage, Cicero may
have misstated the fact. Agathocles, Rc.
307 01· 306, destroyed a large part of the in-
habitants with circumstances of the greatest
cruelty, in order to get their money. He ,
sold the women and children, and gave
the city a new name, Dicaeopolis, and a
fresh population (Diod. xx. 71). After his
death the remnant of the old inhabitants
returned, and the city resumed its former
name.
