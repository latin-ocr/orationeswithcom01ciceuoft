10. Phaselis rga] ‘Antea' means ‘ori-
ginallv? Phaselis, now Tekrova, was a
Ly cian town on the coa ·,t on a 3111311 pen-
insula at the foot of Taktalu, the ancient
Solyma, the bare summit of which 11303
7800 feet above the sea. It had three
ports, and there was a lake on the isthmus
which joined to the main land the peninsula
on which Phaselis stood. Its position is
well described by Livy (Lib. 37. 0. 23).
The flat top of the peninsula is covered
with ruins, and the identity of the place is
proved by Greek inscriptions: ΦΑΣΗΛΕῙ-
ΤΩΝΗΒΟΎΛΗΚΑῙΟΔΗΜΟΣς &ca There is
a description of Phaselis in Beaufort’s
Karamania.

These Lycii were Greeks, as Cicero ob-
ser5 03, and 5ve have an account of their
politica] constitution' 111 Strabo (p. 664, ed.
Cas..) The Lycii of Homer appear in the
war of Troy.

C. οαύοηί3,] See Lib. 3. c. 80. C. Cato,
consul Β. C. 114, a grandson of the Censor.
He had Macedonia for his pr05 11100 w here
he got money by illegal means, 55 as tried,
convicted, and fined. As to the‘ impedi-
menta retinuit‚' I find no further informa-
tion.-*‘ At cujus hominis θ’ 300 Lib. 2.
c. 45.

[ita] C. Cato,] Zumpt has followed Er-
nesti in placing these words, ‘ita C. Cato . .
sororis filius,’ in [], He supposes them to
have been transferred into the text from a
marginal 11οῒος 311(1 110 adds, “Auctor‚ a
quo petita videntur, in promptu est, Vel-
leius, Lib. ii. 8: Mandetur deinde inemo-
riae severitas judiciorum, quippe C. Cato
consularis, M. Catonis nepos, Africani 30-

roris filius (nepos igitur L. Aemilii Paulli)
repetundarum ex Macedonia damnatus est
cum lis ejus 1111 aestimaretur? The pre-
cise 311111 is uncertain, owing to the diversity
in the MSS. See Lib. 3. c. 80. Klotz
(Vorrede, p. 13) eontends that the pas-
sage is right. He points the disputed part
thus, ‘condemnatus est: ita C. Cato duo-
rum . ‚filius3’ and explains it thus, ‘YeS,
C. Cato, ἅο, was condemned.' Hc makes
‘ita’ corrse pond to the German ja, so ist
es? I am not acquainted with this peculiar
use of‘ ita? and Klotz 13 not accustomed to
support his explanations by instance& I
think, however, that 110 is right in rejecting
Zumpt's supposition that these words have
been interpolated from paterculus, The
words are undoubtedly genuine, but there
seems to be something wrong in the con-
nexion between ‘ condemnatus est ³ and
what follows. The blunder appears to be
in the ‘ita,' and if itis omitted, perhaps
the difficulty' 13 removed. Though I cannot
accept Klotz’ 3 explanation, I lem 0 the
words standing, as genuine, and h av ing
enclosed‘ ita' in the critical [], I commend
the passage to the consideration of the
learned. Iordan has included in [] the
words ‘ita- C. Cato . . . aestimata est?
quum judicia fiebant,] Zumpt has ‘quum
severa judicia fiebant,' and yet he says that
¹ severa ³ is wanting in all the better MSS.
But it may be omitted. Iordan only notes
it as wanting in Ra, λ. Compare Lib. 5.
c. 59, ‘quum judicia fiebant 3’ and c. 12,
‘ 11011 jus dici, 11011 judicia fieri.' Klotz ,
omits it in this passage. See Lib. 3. c. 90,
note 011 ‘ ad quae exempla?
