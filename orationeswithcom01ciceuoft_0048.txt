30 IN Q. CAECILIUM

L. Apuleium esse video proximum subscriptorem, hominem non
aetate sed usu forensi atque exercitatione tironem. Deinde, ut
opinor, habet Alienum, hunc tamen ab subselliis, qui quid in dicendo
posset nunqualnsatis attendi ; in clamando quidem video eum esse
bene robustum atque exercitatum. In hoc spes tuae sunt omnes ε
1110, si tu eris actor constitutus, totum judicium sustinebit. At ne
is quidem tantum contendet in dicendo quantum potest, sed consulet
laudi et existimationi tuae, et ex* eo quod ipse potest in dicendo
aliquantum remittet ut tu tamen aliquid esse videare. Ut in actor-
ibus Graecis fieri videmus, saepe illum qui est secundarum aut
tertiarum partium, quum possit aliquanto clarius dicere quam ipse
primarum, multum summittere, ut ille princeps quam maxime
excellat3 sic faciet Alienus3 tibi serviet, tibi lenocinabitur; minus
aliquanto contendet quam potest. J am hoc considerate cujusmodi
accusatores in tanto judicio simus habituri, quum et ipse Alienus
ex ea facultate si quam habet aliquantum detracturus sit, et Caeci-
lius tum denique se aliquid futurum putet, si Alienus minus vehe-
mens fuerit et sibi primas in dicendo partes concesserit. Quartum

ab subselliis,] This expression is explained
to signify ‘ a man practised in the com-ts!
‘ Subsellium‚’ from ‘ sella,' means apparently
a continuity of seats, a bench, called ‘ sub-
sellium? with reference to something higher.
‘Subsellia,’ the seats of the ‘judices,² are
sometimes opposed to the tribunal of the
presiding judge (In Vatin. c. 14). Cicero
says that Alienus had 110 other knowledge
of conducting a cause than what he got by
sitting on the ‘ subsellia ;' but in this pas-
sage it cannot mean the ‘ subsellia' of the
‘judices' It is used, 111 its more general
sense, for any seats occupied by witnesses
and others, as in Pro Q. Rose. Amer. c. 6,
“ Quorum alterum sedere in accusatorum
subselliis vides.'' See also De Or. i. 62.

quid . . . posset . . . attendi ;] “lubuit
attendere quae res maxime tanta negotia
sustinuisset? Sall. Cat. 53. See Act. ii.
Lib. 3. 6. 5, note.

At me] ‘Ac ne' Iordan, with most of
the MSS. It is often very difficult to deter-
mine whether ‘ at' or ‘ ac ’ is the true
reading.

Ut in actoribus Graecis] The allusion is
to Greek plays and Greek actors3 and to
the πρωταγωνιστής, δευτεραγωνιστής, and
τριταγωνιστής, who took the first, second,
and third parts. See Heindorf’s note on
Horace, ‘ posset qui ferre secundas' (1 Sat.
ix. 46„ and Ars Poet. 192. Cicero cx-
plains his own meaning. ‘ Actor' bas a

double sense.

smnmittere,] ‘ Lower the voice,' or, gene-
rally, ‘put a restraint on their powers?
Comp. De Am. c. 20, “ ut ii qui superiores
sunt summittere se debent in amicitia, sic
quodam modo inferiores extollere ;'’ a pas-
sage which has sometimes been misunder-
stood. See Seyti'ert’s note 011 it.—‘ 16110-
cinabitur :³ Cicero uses an odious word,
somewhat difficult to render. A ‘leno ' is
one who gets his living by the prostitution
of slaves, or by assisting in illicit cohabita-
tion. Terence in his Phormio has a ‘lenos
‘Alienus,' says Cicero, ‘will act like one
who plays a second part 3 he will be your
slave, your pimp.' See Act. ii. Lib. 1.
6. 12.

et sibi primas] Most of the MSS. have
‘ tibi,' which is evidently a mistake.

Quartum] Zumpt, quoted by Klotz, re-
marks that it was usual to have four ‘ aceu-
satores ;' and we might almost safely make
the inference from this passage. “ Defende-
runt Scaurum sex patroni, cum ad id
tempus raro quisquam pluribus quam qua-
tuor uteretur: ac post bella civilia ante
legem J uliam ad duodenos patronos est
perventum ’² (Ascon. in Scaur. p. 20, ed.
Orell.).—‘ moratorum ³ is an emendation
of Cujacius3 the MSS. have ‘oratorum'
or ‘ meatorum? The correctness of the
emendation is supposed to be confirmed by
the context and the words of Asconius,
