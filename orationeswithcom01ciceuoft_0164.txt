146 IN G. VERREM

aequitatem, edicta omnium negligit. Ex EDICTO VRBANO. SI DE
HEREDITATE AMBIGITVR. . . .SI POSSESSOR SPONSIONEM NON FA-
OIET. Jam quid id ad praetorem uter possessor sit? nonne id
quaeri oportet utrum possessorem esse oporteat? Ergo quia pos-
sessor est, non moves possessione3 si possessor non esset, non dares.
Nusquam enim scribis, neque tu aliud quicquam edicto complecteris
nisi eam causam pro qua pecuniam acceperas. J am hoc ridiculum
est. SI DE HEREDITATE AMBIGITVR ET TABVLAE 'TESTAMENTI'

ME PROFERENTVR, SEOVNDVM TABVLAS TESTAMENTI POTISSIMVM

HEREDITATEM DAEOt hoc translatitium est: sequi illud oportet, SI

si possessor] Klotz reads ‘si est pos-
sessor,' and Asconius says ‘ subauditur es&
because there is a reading ‘ si et,' &cn 3 but
it does not seem necessary to read ‘ si cst?
Cicero quotes the words of the edict of
VerreS, ‘if the person in possession shall
not make the Sponsio,' &c Cicero's
argument is, Verres says ‘si possessor 5'
but the question is not whO is in possession,
but who ought to be: according to your
edict, because a man is in possession, you
don't disturb him3 and, for the same
rea-son, if a man was not in possession, you
would not give him the possession.

Possession herc is to be taken in its pro-
per sense. If two parties disputed about
the ownership of a thing, he who is in pos-
session must be the defendant, and he wh04
is not in possession has the burden of prov· ῃ
ing his title. If therefore it was uncer-
tain who was in possession, or who must
be considered ‘ possessor,' this question
must be settled first; and the praetor*
settled this by a ‘possessorial interdictst
When Cicero then says ‘ uter possessor
sit,' he simply means which of the two is
in the corporea] possession of the thing,
but that does not determine which of the
two ought to bc considered ‘possessor ’ for
the purposes of the suit, for the actual pos-
sessor might not be entitled to the posses-
sion. Zumpt says, “ si quaeris, quod boni
ex ista temporaria possessione 1101111111 con-
tingere potuerit, unuin hoc vetere proverbio
respondeo: Beati possidentes.” Such an
answer however will not satisfy every
body. (Excursus v.)

Jam hoc ridiculum est] This is not
more ridiculous than thc pointing of Zumpt
and others, who place (z) after ‘ ridiculum
est? and a full stop after ‘hereditatem
dabo.' There is nothing ridiculous in the
‘translatitium edi ctum‚’ whichCicerO quotes.
The ‘ ridiculum ' lies elsewhere. ‘ J am hoe '

refers to what precedes.

Sa· (Ie hereditate ἀτη] Here we have a
portion of the edict. The praetor gave
the ‘bonorum possessio? (1) when there
was no testament (Dig. 38. tit. 6, “si ta-
bulae testamenti nullae extabunt ³³), that is,
a ‘possessio’ in the case of intestacy, of
which there were several caseS, determined
by thc class of persons who in succession
were entitled ς (2) if there was a testanient 3
and in this case either ‘ contra tabulas ' or
‘secundum tabulas? ‘ 1f,’ says the edict,
‘ a will is produced with the proper number
of seals, that is, not fewer than seven, Ι
will give the Hereditas according to the
terms of the testament? He ought to Say
‘ possessio,' for the praetor could not make
a ‘heres’ (Gaius, iii. 32) ,- he could only
allow a person to take possession of the
property: but ‘hereditas,’ in the sense of
‘ possessio hereditatis,’ may have been used.
In c. 47 there is the expression ‘posses—
sionem hereditatis,' which Hotmann pro-
posed to read here. Zumpt and Iordan
here read ‘ possessionem ' for ‘ hereditatem:
and this reading is in one MS. (Lg. 29.)

hoc translatitium est: (90] These are
the words of Cicero, who says that this
part of the edict of Verres is adopted from
former edicts, and is all right. (Comp.
Dig. 38. tit. 6, ‘si tabulae testamenti
nullae,' &c.) If no ‘tabulae’ were pro-
duced, then the ternis of the edict ought to
be as in c. 44, ‘Posteaquam jus praeto-
rium,' &c. Comp. Dig. 38. 7. 1, “Haec verba.
edicti: Tum quem ei heredem esse opor-
teret,” &c. But Cicero makes Verres say,
‘then he win give the Hereditas to hi1n‹
who says that he is Heres,’ that is, tO a
man who affirms that he is Heres by the
testament, but does not produce the testa-
ment. Klotz supposes that Verres may
have said, ‘ 1 will give it to him who proves
himself to be Heres! But, if Verres
