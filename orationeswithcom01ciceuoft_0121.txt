q temporis ejus quod mihi ad dicendum datur, quoniam in animo est
causam omnem exponere, habenda ratio est diligenter.

XII. Itaque primum illum actum istius vitae turpissimum et
flagitiosissimum praetermittam. Nihil a me de pueritiae suae

quae qualis fuerit aut meministis aut ex eo quem sui simillimum
produxit recognoscere potestis. Omnia praeteribo quae mihi
turpia dictu videbuntur, neque solum quid istum audire, verum
etiam quid me deceat dicere considerabo. Vos, quaeso, date hoc
et concedite pudori meo, ut aliquam partem de istius impudentia
reticere possim. Omne illud tempus, quod fuit antequam iste ad
magistratus remque publicam accessit, habeat per me solutum ac
liberum. Sileatur de nocturnis eJ'us bacchationibus ac vigiliis3

cora, quae res patris ejus, aetas ipsius pertulit, praetereantur;

their own bcnefit, not a ‘ cautio ³ as to the
sum of money, for the money-ternis are
not the question here. ; but a ‘ cautio ' as to
time, for the ‘redemptio' was ‘sub con-
ditione‚' provided the affair was postponcd
till after thc first of January. Sec Act.

Verres produced his son at the trial, or is
here supposed to have brought him into
court; and as· to this Roman falshion, hc
refers to Quintilian, lust. ()r. xi. c. 3, ξ 171.
'Phe purpose ‹›f Cicero’s foul abuse of the
son is explained by Asconius after his
fashion. lt has been suggested tome that
‘produxit ' may mean ‘ genuit ' in this pas-
sage. Ι think it is possible that Cicero
purposcly used a. word which may have two
meaning-s. There is no doubt that it cun
