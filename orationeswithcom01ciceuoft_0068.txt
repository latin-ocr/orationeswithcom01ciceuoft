50 J UDIOIA.

The legislation of Rome in the department of Crimina] Law is very
scanty for the period which precedes the Lex Calpurnia. Leges were
enacted to prevent Ambitus, or the improper means of obtaining the
votes of the people at elections, and on some few other matters. The
difficulty of a trial before a public body would increase when the guilt
or innocence of a man did not depend on a single fact, but on many
facts and many witnesses; and the impartiality of the popular vote
would often be disturbed by the spirit of faction. The Senate, as the
administrative body, had or assumed the power of appointing special
commissioners to inquire into offences, which belonged to the cognizance
of the Comitia3 and these special commissions may have suggested the
establishment of a permanent court for the trial of offences. A Quaestio
Perpetua was first established by the Lex Calpurnia (13.0. 149). The
term Perpetua in the Quaestio Perpetua is to be understood in the
same way as Perpetuum iu the Edictum Perpetuum. The Quaestio
Perpetua. was a court which had permanence during the term of office
of the Magistratus who was the president of it. Perpetua accordingly is
the same as Annua, and the court thus established was so called in
opposition to those which were established sor a special occasion and
with a special president, Quaesitor or Quaestor. These Quaestiones per-
petuae, or permanent courts, were afterwards extended to other offences
besides that of Repetundae3 and this was fully effected by the legis-
lation of Sulla. His legislation established or confirmed nine Quaes-
tiones. The Quaestio Perpetua was au improvement on the courts
of the Comitia3 but though the people lost most of their judicial
power, the Comitia were still considered the supreme judges, and
they still exercised the judicial functions in some caseS, as iu that of
Perduellio.

The criminal trials at Rome were now conducted pursuant to the
several Leges, which were applicable to them. Each Lex defined the
crime, determined the punishment, and contained provisions as to the
constitution of the court before which an accused person was to be tried.
There was no code which comprehended all the matters which came under
the denomination of Publica Crimina; but certain Leges, commonly

called Leges J udiciariae, contained certain general regulations as to the
mode of procedure.

The establishment of a Quaestio Perpetua by the Lex Calpurnia
gave the Senatorius Ordo a. power which they had before only exercised
occasionally. Before the enactment of the Lex Calpurnia, the Senate
possessed a concurrent jurisdiction with the Comitia, as we have already
seen; for crimes were tried either by the assembled people, or by a
Consilium of Senators under the presidency of one or more magistrates
