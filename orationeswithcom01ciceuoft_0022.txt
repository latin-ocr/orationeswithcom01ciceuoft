the political power. It was a safer policy for an ambitious Roman, who
was not yet ennobled, to gain the good-will of those whose votes might
raise him to the highest honours of the state, than to serve the sena-
torial party. When Cicero had taken his place among the nobiles, by
having filled a curule magistracy, it would be easy for him to gain the
good-will of the optimates ; for such a class, however proud and exclusive,
has a secret pleasure in seeing its ranks recruited by men who can infuse
fresh vigour into an effete body.

In the year Bc 70 the praetor M’. Acilius Glabrio presided in the
trials for repetundae, and early in the year Cicero applied to him for
permission to prosecute Verres. But at the same time Q. Caecilius
Niger claimed to be the prosecutor of Verres, 01· at least to be one of
the prosecutors (Div. 15), probably prompted by Hortensius. The
prosecution in the hands of Caecilius would either have failed for want
of being properly conducted, or through the bad faith of the prosecutor.
Caecilius was a Roman citizen, but probably a Sicilian by birth, and he
had been quaestor under Verres sor the district of Lilybaeum. He
urged that Verres had done him wrong, that he was therefore his
enemy, that he was well acquainted with the facts of the governor’s mis-
conduct, and, for all these reasons, he was the fittest person to conduct
the prosecution. The first question to be decided was, whether Cicero
or Caecilius should conduct the prosecution. The first of Cicero’s
Verrine Orations, entitled ‘De Divinassioness was therefore in defence
of himself and against Caecilius. He had to support his own claims as
the chosen advocate of the Sicilians, and to destroy those of Caecilius,
whom the Sicilians rejected3 to show his opponent’s unfitneSS, without
urging his own qualifications beyond the limits of a modest confidence:
and he did all this well. The decision was in favour of Cicero, and he
conducted the prosecution alone. Halm infers from a passage in the
orations (Act. ii. Lib. 4. c. 65) that Cicero's cousin Lucius was his
subscriptor, or assistant in the prosecution, but that is more than can be
inferred from Cieero’s words.

Cicero asked and obtained from the praetor Glabrio one hundred and
ten days for a voyage to Sicily to collect evidence against Verres3 but a
new device was resorted to by his opponents. At the instigation of
Verres (Act. i. e. 2, 3), a person proposed to institute a prosecution which
concerned Achaea, and a senator was selected as the man to ‘be pro-
secuted3 but Cicero does not mention his name. This person asked for
only one hundred and eight days for going to Achaea and returning to
Rome. If he returned within the hundred and eight days, and com-
menced his prosecution, Cicero’s attack on Verres must be deferred, and

'perhaps it might be put off until the next year. But this trick failed.
The salse prosecutor never got as far as Brundusium, while Cicero
