288 IN 0. VERREM

et quaesivi omnia: inveni duos solos libellos a L. Canuleio missos
sociis ex portu Syracusis, in quibus erat ratio scripta mensium
complurium rerum exportatarum istius nomine sine portorio. Ita·
que obsignavi statim. Erant haec ex eo genere quod ego maxime
genus ex sociorum literis reperire cupiebam3 verum tantum inveni,
judices, quod apud vos quasi exempli eausa proferre possem. Sed
tamen quidquid erit in his libellis, quantulumcunque videbitur esse,
1100 quidem certe manifestum erit: de ceteris ex 1100 conjecturam ’
faeere debetis. Recita mihi, quaeso, 1111110 primum libellum: deinde
illum alterum. LIBELLi CANVLEJANI. Non quaero, unde 0000
amphoras mellis habueris, unde tantum Melitensium, unde quinqua-
ginta tricliniorum lectos, unde tot candelabra: non, inquam, jam
quaero unde haec habueris; sed quo tantum tibi opus fuerit, id
quaero. Mitto de melle: sed tantum Melitensium, quasi etiam
amicorum uxores—tantum lectorum, quasi omnium istorum villas
ornaturus esses.

LXXV. Et quum haec paucorum mensium ratio in his libellis
sit, facite ut vobis triennii totius veniat in mentem. Sic contendo ;
ex 1115 parvis libellis apud unum magistrum societatis repertis vos
jam conjectura assequi posse eujusmodi praedo iste in illa provincia

mensium complurium] Zumpt finds a eo genere? “Vellem erat aliud ex eodem
difficulty in deoiding if we should write genere, sive erant alia vcl plura ex eodem,
‘mensium’ or ‘mensumj for the MSS. genet-(33³ It is singular that a good critic
have both. He takes 110 notice of the should take such pains to spoil what is so
fact, that ‘ mensi-s' should regularly have clear. All that the MSS. could justify us
‘mensi-um.’ It is truc that Ovid has in doing 15, 10 change ‘eo' into ‘eodem‚'

‘mensum' (Met. viii. 500), as the editors
write it; but we may make ‘mensium' a
dissyllable. There are several words of
this declension which drop the ‘i' in the
genitive plural, and ‘mensis' may be one
of them. See Key's Grammar, ‘ Rcmarks
on the Third or I Declensi0n3' and the
note of Creuzer and Moser, who give seven
reasons for ‘ mensum.5

obsignavi statim] It appears that the
prosecutor had authority to put a seal on
such written testimony as he could find,
and, as it seems, to carry it off with him 3
or, at any rate, to call upon the person in
whose possession the papcrs were to pro-
duce them with the seals. Au excepted
case, as to carrying written evidence 10
Rome, is mentioned at the end of 0. 76.

Erant haec [Va] There. seems no occa-
sion to adopt the suggestion of Hotmann,
‘ N cc crant 1111003 Cicero found something
that 110 was looking for, but it was not
much. It was enough however to serve as
a samplc. Again, Zumpt would mend ‘cx

which seems no improvement. Klotz has
‘ erant haec ex eodem? Halm suggests
‘ erant haee ex eo quidem,' which is better.

amicorum uxores] Cicero suggests that
the Malta vests were intended as presents
for the wives of those whom Verres honoured
with his dubious friendship.—‘ mitto :’ com-
pare Lib. 4. 0. 3, ‘mitto jam rationem?
Zumpt and Iordan have “ omitto,’ from Lg.
42 p. m. On the same authority he omits
‘ ne ' after ‘ tantum,' but his reason 15 not
worth 11111011. ‘N e' is not however wanted:
“ I say nothing of the honey z but such a
quantity of Malta rests—as if you were
going to dress out even your fricnds' wives
—such a number of couches, as if you
were going to furnish the ‘ villae ’ of all of
them.’' Tacitus has a like use of ‘sed'
(Ami. i. 10), ‘ Sane Cassii> &cn 3 ‘sed Pom-
peium ³ 810.
