338 IN O. VERREM

quo deverteretur datus esset, coguntur Herbitenses ei lucri dare
tritici modium xxxvn millia, quum decumae venissent tritici mo-
dium xvui. Atque hoc tantum lucri coguntur dare publice tum
quum jam privatim aratores ex agris, spoliati atque exagitati
decumanorum injuriis, profugissent. Anno secundo quum emisset
Apronius decumas tritici modium {KV DCC, et ipse Herbitam cum

De accessione dubito an Apronio ipsi data sit merces operae atque
impudentiae ; de tritici quidem numero tanto quis potest dubitare
quin ad istum praedonem frumentarium, sicut Agyrinense frumen-
tum, pervenerit? Anno tertio vero in hoc agro consuetudine usus

that Atidius came to Herbita as a ‘ prae-
fectus juri dicundo' (praefecti nomine) ;
which will explain why a lodging was fur·
nished him by the town. He was both a
farmer of the ‘decumae ’ and a ‘praefec-
tus.' Cicero tells us, in the passages
above cited, that when he was governor
of Cilicia, he refused to give a ‘praefec-
tura' to any negotiator, lest the sources
of justice should be corrupted.

et accessionis] This is the reading of
N V φ, and is preferable to the common
reading ‘accessionem’ for the genitive is
of the same form as ‘ lucri.¹

operae ᾦα] The common reading is
‘merces operae pretiumque impudentiae)
The text is that of Lg. 42 V. Zumpt and
Iordan have ‘ anno vero tertio.'

33. barbaros reyes] By ‘ Syrorum ’
Cicero cannot mean the Greek kings of
Syria, but he must mean the Assyrians;
for the names Syrian and Assyrian are
often confounded. XVhatever the practice
may have been with the barbarian Syrian
or Assyrian kings, it was the fashion with
the Persians. Klotz quotes the passage of
Plato from the first Alcibiades, p. 123:
ἐπεί ποτ’ ἐγὼ ἤκουσα ἀνδρὸς ἀξιοπίστου,
Sec. Xenophon, in his Anabasis, mentions
certain villages, which the army came to,
that were set apart for the gii-dle of Queen
Parysatis (i. 4. 10).

Klotz refers to Bottiger’s Sabina to show

that these extravagant dames of antiquity
could spend the income of a whole com-
munity 011 such ornaments as Cicero al-
ludes to. This may be so 3 but it seems
more reasonable to consider that these do-
nations were made nominally for such and
such purpose, not because a woman re-
quired the revenue of a whole district to
keep her hair or head-gear in order.
When Artaxerxes provided royally for the
traitor Themistocles (Thucyd. i. 138), by
giving him Magnesia as bread, Lampsacus
as wine, and so forth, the Greek made
something of his bread, for it amounted to
fifty talents the year, rather more than he
and his household would consume. See
Athenaeus also, Lib. i. p. 29, ed. Casaub.

his autem moribus] ‘iis autem' &c-
Klotz.

attribuere] ‘to assign.’ This word is
also used to express a territory and people
being placed in a state of dependence on
another people. See Caesar, Β. G. vii. 9.

mulieri] ‘mulierem' V, i. e. ‘mulieri
in, ut Hotom. egregie emendavit? Halm.
This is a certain emendation, and Halm
has acutely confirmed it by his interpreta-
tion of the reading of V.

esse dueebat,] ‘ Sic Nannianus, nostri
omnes dicebat ² (Zumpt). Zumpt has ‘ (lu-⁴
nebat? Klotz and Iordan have ‘dicebat.'
We can hardly suppose that Verres called
