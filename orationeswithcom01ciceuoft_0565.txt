AOT. II. LIBER QUINTUS. 547

initium iste non a Favonio neque ab aliquo astro notabat, sed quum
rosam viderat, tum incipere ver arbitrabatur, dabat se labori atque
itineribus, 111 quibus eo usque se praebebat patientem atque impi-
grum ut eum nemo unquam in equo sedentem viderit. XI. Nam,
ut mos fuit Bithyniae regibus, lectica oetophoro ferebatur, in qua
pulvinus erat perlucidus Melitensis, rosa fartus: ipse autem coro-
nam habebat unam in capite, alteram in collo, reticulumque ad
nares sibi admovebat, tenuissimo lino, minutis maculis, plenum
rosae. Sic confecto itinere, quum ad aliquod oppidum venerat,
eadem lectica usque in cubiculum deferebatur. Eo veniebant
Siculorum magistratus, veniebant equites Romani, id quod ex
multis juratis audistis: controversiae secreto deferebantur, paulo
post palam decreta auferebantur. Deinde ubi paulisper 111 011111-
culo pretio, non aequitate, jura descripserat, Veneri jam et Libero
reliquum tempus deberi arbitrabatur. Quo loco non mihi praeter-
mittenda videtur praeclari imperatoris egregia ac singularis dili-

Favonio]

“Solvitur acris hiems grata vice veris et
Favoni.'’—Hor. 1 Carm. iv.

Verres waited for the blooming of the
reses, He did not reckon the commence-
ment of spring 111 the usual way. Varro
(Dc R. R. 1. 28), quoted by Hotmann,
says ‘ dies primus est veris 111 Aquario,' &e.
Zumpt refers to Pliny, H. N. xxi. 11.

sedentem viderit] ‘ Videret ’ 15 the com-
mon readiug; but R3 Lg. 29 have ‘vi-
derit’ These forms are often confounded.
Madvig remarks that ‘videret' is a uni-
versal negation, and is not much more than
‘ videre soleret ς’ the perfect, with the ad-
dition of ‘nemo unquam‚' signifies that it
did not take place even 01100.

11. oetophoro] He was carried in a litter
or palankeeu by eight 111011. His 0115111011 was
of the fine linen of Malta (Lib. 2. 0. 72),
stuffed with rose—leaves. He had a small
bag of the finest thread, ‘a bug of 11110
gauze or netted work, such as is still used
to enclose seents3’ as 1 am reminded by
the Rev. R. Blackburn. In the former
edition I took ‘maculis' to mean ‘spots ;’
but Mr. Blackburn remarks that the word
‘reticulum' evidently points to the sense
of ‘ mes-hes? See Forecllini.

T1·avelling in a lettiga (lectica) is still
used in Sicily. The lcttiga 15 a kind of
narrow chaise, with room for two persons
to sit opposite to cuch other, mounted on
two long poles, and carried by mules at the
average rate of three miles and a half an

hour (Smyth's Sicily, p. 8). But this is not

a Roman ‘lectica‚’ which was intended for
reclining. The ‘sella' was for sitting, a
kind of sedan.

Klotz refers to Bottiger’s Sabina, Τ11. 11.
p. 181, 204, 212. He adds that at a later
period the Roman ladies generally used
such ‘lecticae,’ and that the practice was
derived frou] Asia, whence they also got
chair—bearers (lecticarii). The use of these
‘lecticae' was not confined to luxurious
persons, for Servius Sulpicius used one
(Cicero, Ep. ad Div. iv. 12). His health
was probably not good. Lipsius (Elect. i.
c. 19. Vol. i. cd. Vesal.) has, as usual, all
the learning in this matter. The ‘ lectica'
was not common in Italy about the time
of C. Gracchus, as an extract from one of
his specches shows (Genius, x. 3). The
Bithynian origin ot· the ‘lectica’ seems
hinted at hy Catullus, or at lenst Bithynia
was a country where a man might supply
himself with porters for his ‘ lectica :'

“At certe tumen, inquiunt, quod illie
Natum dicitur esse, comparasti
Ad lecticam hon1ines.'’
Catull. x. ed. Sillig.

jura descripserass] There is no notice
of ‘ discripserat ’ in the readings, and yet I
believe that it is the right word here, und
Huhn has 5ο written it on his authority, 1
believe, as 1 have done sometimes, und uny
body may do here, ifhe likes. b'ee Lib. 3.
0. 92, note; and Cicero, De Off. i. 34, “ jura
deseribere,’ according to the common reud-
ing.
