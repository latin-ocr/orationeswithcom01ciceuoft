ad cupiditatem, sed [ad] ejusmodi facinus in quo omnia nefaria
contineri mihi atque inesse videantur3 in quo dii immortales vio-
lati, existimatio atque auctoritas nominis populi Romani imminuta,

purpuram] Zumpt points ‘Ipse dabat
purpuram, tantum operam amici? Perhaps
a Roman could tell how this was to be
taken without the aid of points. If he
could· not, his language would be uncertain.
But Ι think that the form of the sen-
tence requires the pause after ‘tantulus
Klotz, Iordan, and Halm put the point
after ‘ purpuram. '—‘ Ipse (labat ’ tem-13

Verres ‘he 0111) gzwe the pur··pmi, his
friends did the w·;'01k whi‹h w ·15 worth
more than the material. ‘1 suppose so,’
says Cicero, ‘but it is charge enough
against him that he had so much to give ;
and besides it is an admission that he
made use of his friends to supply the
labour.' lt was no criminal oll'ence for 11
man's friends to work sor him, if the3’ did
it voluntaril3=¹; and all these fine. things
were produced, as the (1010111101- of Verres
would say, by the voluntary work of his
friends on the material which Verres fur—
nished. Halm explains it: ‘he furnished
the material, they only the work ;’ and he
takes ‘tantum opernm’ to bean ironieal
expression, as if the lahour were 11 trifle.
But he has placed ¹ lpse . . . amici ' within
inverted commas, as if smnehody said this
to Cicero, and said it ironieall3', which is
1101150115οι and the answer ‘eredo' nmkes
it greater nonsense. Shortly after the
same friend of Verres says ‘Emebat‚' to

the pause is rightly placed after ‘ pur-
puram,' there is an emphasis on ‘ Ipse,' and
the meaning is, ‘ Verres supplied the stust',
his friends only the labour ;’ as if the
labour were a small matter and the stutf
were every thing. But it 15- a serious de-

27. reyes Suriam] Zumpt has u note on
this passage, the substance of which is as
follows. These kings were Antiochus and
Seleucus, the sons ol’ Antiochus Eusehes',
who was now dead. 'l'he elder of these two,
Antiochus Asiaticus, wisi aste·‘1n ·11-(15 de-

claim was undispute d, for their compe titors,

been dead; but Tigranes, the son-in-law of
Mithridates, was actually in possession of
Syria, to which comiti-3· the Syriuns them-
selves had invitcd him (u.e.83). being wear3’

Zumpt says that Cicero suppressed this
fact, that these kings might not appear
