AOT. II. LIBER TERTIUS. 369

tanto tuo dedecore profecto ne verbo quidem graviore appellasses,
neque apud te tam sancta religio societatis fuisset ut tui capitis
periculum negligeres, nisi rem tam notam esse omnibus et tam
manifestam Videres.

LIX. Cum eodem Apronio postea P. Scandilius, eques Romanus,
quem vos omnes nostis, eandem sponsionem de societate fecit quam
Rubrius facere voluerat. Institit, oppressit, non remisit : facta est
sponsio HS V: coepit Scandilius recuperatores aut judicem postu-
lare. Satisne vobis praetori improbo circumdati cancelli videntur
in sua provincia, immo vero in sella ac tribunali, ut aut de suo
capite judicium fieri patiatur praesens ac sedens aut confiteatur

36 omnibus judiciis convinci necesse esse?
APRons socmM IN DECUMIS ESSE DICAT.

ne verbo quidem effa] ‘ Locus difficilis?
says Zumpt. Manutius thought that ‘ non'
should be inserted before ‘profecto,' and
Ernesti did it. ‘Appellare asperius: or
‘verbo graviore‚' is ‘to reprove.' Zumpt
says that the sense of the text is this:
‘Now, with respect to you and Apro-
nius, &c., you would not, in a matter so
discreditable to yourself, have been satisfied
even with giving him a reproof, nor &0223
—you would not have spoken to him at all,
not even 111 words of reproof; you would
have sent him away? Still there is some-
thing very awkward in this sentence, and
it is possible that there is error in the
text. The position of ‘tu Apronium' is
one of the contrasts which are common in
Latin.

59. oppres-sm] ‘hc kept 01030 to him,
110 110111 him fast (oppressit), he would not
let the man go?

Hs V :] Most of the 1113310111 ‘ Hs 1“.’
Τ110 horizontal line, which denotes 1111111-
31111113, 13 often omitted. 'she full expres-
sion is ‘sestertium quinque millium.' See
Lib. 5. c. 54.

cancelli] ‘ Cancelli ’ (in Greek κιγκλίδες,
δρύφακτος) 13 1111 enclosurc of 11·0011, 111· ιι
railing, or any thing of the kind, hy which
a 1111100 13 enclosed 111111 111-01001011 (Force -
lini). The word occurs in Pro l'. Quintio,
0. 10, Pro Sestio, 0. 58. Salmasius, who
has a prodigialis long note on ‘ Cam-ellarii '
and ‘ Cancelli ' (llis-t.. Any. p. 483, ed. Paris,
1620), says: “ 310 κιγκλίδες sunt proprie
cancelli: οἱ ἐπὶ κιγκλίδων, cancellarii:
κιγκλίδα Graeci τὴν τοῦ δικαστηρίου θύραν
passim interpretantnr. Latini tamen can-
cellos non tantum sores τοῦ δικαστηρίου,
sed etiam 0111110. conseptum appellant.

VOL. 1.

Sponsio est, NI TE
Provincia tua est:

confundunt, et δρυφάκτους, καγγέλλους
passini exponunt: nam δρύφακτοι, nt dixi,
proprie sunt septa¹ judicialium secretorum :
hinc cancellorum septa vocat Ammianus
Marcellinus, Lib. xxx. de advocatis : ‘ 011111
intra cancellorum venerint septa et agi
coeperint alicujus fortuna vel salus.2 ’³
This will explain what the ‘cancelli' are.
‘ Cancellarii ' were door-keepers, who stood
at the outer bounds or limits of the court
(cancelli), in the later empire (Betlnnann-
Hollweg, Handbuch des Civilprozesses, o& 0.,
p. 190). Those who are curious may traee
this name of Cancellarius from 1113 11111111110
dnties of a door-keeper to his higher duties
of Chancellor in modern tina-s.

Cicero says, “Don’t yon think that a
wicked praetor was shut up 01030 enough
in 1113 own province, l would say, 1111 1113
jndgment-seat and tribunal. when he 11111311
either in 1113 own presence, and while sitting
there, allow a matter to 110 heard, in which
his own character was implicated, 111· must
consess that he must of necessity he 01111-
1·11·ῒο11 111 ever)⁷ trial?’' 01· ‘in the ,1111111-
1110111 of all ;’ which may 110 the meaning
os ⁴ 011111111113 jud?

lt is 11 metaphor, says Ilotmann (circnm-
dati 0111100111), taken from wild beasts shut
up in enclosures 311 that they cannot escape.
But the metaphor is not wanted. Verres
was 30 110111111011 111, 111-011 111 his 111111 court,
that 11 1111111 would 3111111030 110 must 1111 either
11110 111· the other thing. But Verres did
neither.

provincia,] ‘provintia' Lg. -1⁴2; which
13 worth noting 113 ihc genuine serm. and
the abbreviation of ‘ 111·111’1110111111.’ which
appears also in the 31111110 ⁶ prudentia)
