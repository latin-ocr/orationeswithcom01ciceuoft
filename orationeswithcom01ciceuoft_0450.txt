into the Edictum Urbanum, was thence transferred to the Provinciale ;
for Cicero tells us (Lib. 3. c. 65), that L. Caecilius Metellus, the suc-
cessor of Verres, had admitted the F ormula into his edict at Rome, and
also into his provincial edict. The claim of O. Gallus before Metellus
was, that pursuant to his edict the ‘praetor’ should grant him an
action against Apronius, in respect of “quod per vim et metum—abstu-
lisset.” Cicero, in speaking of the exactions of this scoundrel, uses the
words which brought his acts within the terms of the edict3 ‘iniquas
pactiones vi et metu expressas’-—‘ civitates virgarum ac mortis metu '-
—‘ aratores vi et metu coactos Apronio multo plus quam debuerint
dedisse? There was sufficient reason to allow the action against
Apronius, but Metellus refused it, because he wished to keep back what
would have appeared to the prejudice of Verres in the trial at Rome.
Verres was, indeed, the real culprit, for Apronius only acted as his
tool; but Apronius was at least liable for whatever had come to his
hands. Now Metellus saw, that if Apronius had been condemned to
restore fourfold to O. Gallim, this would have been indireetly a condem-
nation of Verres in the matter of the Repetundae. It was, however, a
principle of law, that when the condemnation of a defendant by Recupe-
ratores, in a civil matter, preceded the trial for a matter that affected a
man’s ‘ caput’ (causa capitalis), the aecused had the advantage of au
exception in this form, ‘extra quam si in reum capitis praejudiciunr
fiat,’ which means, that the result of this trial was not to prejudice him
in the future trial (Cicero, De Invent. ii. 202 “non enim oportet in
recuperatorio judicio ejus maleficii, de quo inter sicarios quaeritur, prae-
judicium fieri’' &c Paulus, Dig. 5. 1. 54: “per minorem causam
majori cognitioni praejudicium fieri non oportet3 major enim '’ &c.: and
Dig. 47. 10. 7. ξ 1). This was precisely the case before Metellus. The
‘ Actio quod metus causa ’ against Apronius would have been decided in
the province, and Verres would have to be tried by a body of senators
at Rome on the charge of Repetundae. Metellus did not wish the
judgment in Sicily, which would certainly have been obtained against
Apronius, to prejudice Verres at Rome in any way: ‘praejudicium se

. . nolle fieri’ (c. 65). Cicero expresses his surprise that Metellus
did not perceive that he was in effect passing judgment on Verres, by
refusing to allow this action: ‘ sed hoc miror . . . judicarit ’ (c. 65).

It has been urged that the words ‘ quod per vim et metum abstulisset ’
cannot have been the words of the Formula, which may be true to a
certain degree. Neither the word ‘quod,' nor the subjunctive ‘abstu-
lisset,' would appear in the Formula3 but the words ‘per vim et
metum abstulisse,' so often repeated by Cicero, ean only be referred to
the Formula as their source. The words ‘ ablata pecunia’ are also one
of the expressions used in the Lex Servilia to designate one of the
