98 IN O. VERREM

‘dedit' or ‘det' is Latin. 1 prefer the
reading of all the MSS„ and Ι can see 110
probability that if Cicero wrote ‘ dedit? all
the MSS. should have ‘ det?

Causam enim, 03²0. . . . Adimo enim ζα]
‘Enim ' has a reference to what has been
said, ‘hoc si non utor,’ &cn It is a sup-
posed answer ε ‘ Yes, but it is necessary for
the case to be investigated.’ To which sup-
posed answer, Cicero rejoins: ‘Admitted,
50 far as this, that a guilty man cannot be
condemned without the case being investi-
gated; but you surely will not make it a
ground of complaint, that I have done any
thing, the tendency of which is to prevent
your client's condemnation? The word
‘ enim ' certainly does not mean ‘ for.’ It is
a word of reference, that is, it respects
something that has gone before 3 but it is
not strictly a word of inference. (Comp.
Pro Q. Rosc. Am. 0. 93 Pro Caecina, 0. 7;
Pro Rabirio Post. c. 14 3 Caesar, B. G. v. 7,
⁶ Ille enim' διο.) Cicero often begins his
sentences with ‘ Etenim,' the meaning of
which is much nearer ‘and indeed,’ ‘in
truth,' than ‘ for? The words ‘ Adimo
enim comperendinatum ' is another sup-
posed objection: ‘You say that Ι prevent
the Comperendinatio 3' to which Cicero re-
plies: ‘the very thing in the Lex that is

‘ dedit' Asconius, Iordan. Either

heard twice, the very 11110 which was esta-
blishedss 810. There is no difficulty in the
second ‘quod aut,' which Orelli placed in
brackets, and Ernesti, who mistook the
whole passage, changed into ‘ id aut.' Iordan
also says ‘Locus vix sanus.² I think it is
quite sound.

comperendinatum] The adjourning of a
trial to the third day ς the defcrring of the
verdict 3 hence also the arguing of the cause
after it was thus adjourned. The word is
compoundetl of ‘ con ³ and ‘perendina,' for
there are the adjective ‘ perendinus ³ and the
form ‘ perendie,' like ‘ pridies ‘ postridie.’
The word ‘perendie ' means the dav after
the morrow, as appears from Cicero to
Atticus, xii. 443 and from a passage in the
oration Pro Murena, 0. 12, “tot 11011111105,
tam ingeniosos per tot annos statuere non
potuisse utrum diem tertium 311 perendinum
dici oporteret.'' See Gellius, x. 24. When
‘ dies tertius' is equivalent to ‘dies perendi-
nus,' the first day and the last are included
in the reckoning, and there is one (lay in
the midffle. The etymology of ‘perendie ³ is
miknown. Asconius has a note on what
follows, the matter of which is apparently
only derived from his notion of the meaning
of the text. He says that when the trial
was adjourned, the accused spoke first, after
having already replied 111 the previous pro-
ceedings, and the prosecutor then spoke
