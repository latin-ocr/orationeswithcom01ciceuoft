XLII. J ure, legibus, auctoritate omnium qui consulebantur
testamentum P. Annius fecerat, non improbum, non inofficiosum,
non inhumanum3 quod si ita fecisset, tamen post illius mortem*
nihil de testamento illius novi juris constitui oporteret. Voconia

metm-itas] Klotz conjectured ‘ prae-
toris auctoritas,’ as V has ‘ P. R. auctoritas.³
Iordan has inserted ‘praetoris ’ before
‘ auctoritas.³

Quis unquam ἐξα] This passage is ob-
scure ; and its meaning could only be fully
ascertained if we had the text of the edict,
instead of the few words which are cited ι
‘ who ever made an edict after this fashion?
who ever by his edict laid a snare or created
a hazard, as to a matter which could nothe
provided against either after or before the
publication of the edict P> Instead of
‘ejus rei’ ‘ei rei' is the reading of V,
which also has ‘neque post edictum, pro-
videri potuit reprehendi neque ante edic-
tu1n,’ out of which Mai made ‘ quae
neque post edictum reprehendi neque ante
edictum provideri potuit.³ Orelli repeats
‘ fecit, fecerit P’ thus. Zumpt contends
that the words ‘fecit, fecerit' are not to
be taken in connexion with the words
‘Qui ab A. Postumio,’ dxc„ but that the
chief part of the edict between ‘postve ea '
and ‘ fecit, fecerit ’ is omitted3 and in his
note, he gives what he supposes to be the
substance of the part which is omitted.
‘ Qui ab A. Postumio,’ &c. cannot, as
Zumpt remarks, refer to the ‘census' of
these ‘ censors ³ as a time to reckon from ς
for, if that were so, the form should be
‘A. Postumio, Q. Fulw'o censoribus ;'
but the ‘ censors' were not thus referred
to for the purpose of a determination of
time. His conclusion is, and probably a
just one, that the words which followed
‘postve ea ' referred to persons being
‘ censi ς’ and ‘ fecit, fecerit ’ referred to the
words ‘ virginem mulieremve heredem.³
The censorship of Postumius and Fulvius
was 13.o. 174. ’

42. testamentum—non improbum] As-

conius explains ‘improbum testamentum '
to be a ‘ testamentum' made ‘contra
leges ;' which, if correctly interpreted,
means in violation of some particular
‘leges.’ But his statement is not worth
any thing. ‘Improbus ’ is ‘non probus,’
‘ not honest or upright ε’ it is joined with
‘intestabilis' in a passage in the Twelve
Tables quoted by Gellius (xv. 13). Neither
‘improbum ’ nor ‘inhumanum ' appears to
have a technical meaning. ‘ Inofficiosum ³
has a technical meaning. A ‘ testamentum
inofficiosum ³ is a testament made in legal
form, ‘ sed non ex officio pietatis,' ‘ not as
a good man ought to make it? If a man
exheredated 1115 own children, or passed
over his parents, or brethren, or sisters,
without some sufficient reason, the will,
though good in form, might be attacked by
these near kinsfolk, who would be his ‘he-
redes ³ in case of intestacy, in a suit called
‘Querela Inofficiosi.’ The persons thus
passed over, would, of course, be supposed
to have merited this mark of the testator's
disapprobation3 but, if the disapprobation
was unmerited, the testator had done them
a. wrong, and their remedy was to get the
will set aside, as made under the influence
of passion. The ultimate object of the
suit, was the vindication of the character
of the co1nplainants3 but the direct effect
of the suit was to set aside the will and
make them ‘heredes’ It is not known
when this form of action was introduced ς
311(1 we cannot conclude because Cicero
uses the term ‘inofficiosum‚' that the
‘Querela Inofficiosi' existed in his time.
-The subject is explained by Savigny,
