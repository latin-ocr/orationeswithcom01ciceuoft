Ϊ INTRODUOTION. 85

Milesians, while he was Dolabella's legatus, he says that he will
,omit the mention of certain things, and will leave them to the
testimony of witnesses who were still to be heard (‘ eaque omnia
testibus integra reservabo;’ see also the end of 6. 35). In c. 40 he
apologizes for sayiug so little about Verres as Praetor Urbanus, and he
adds that he has reserved some things, which relate 10 1116 Praetura
Urbana, for the witnesses to tell. All this talk and all this evidence have
nothing to do with the matters for which Verres was prosecuted.

But Cicero writes (6. 28) as if evidence had been given even in the
Prior Actio about the affair of Lampsacus, and in c. 31 116 affirms that
he had produced and examined witnesses on this matter. Again in
c. 48 he refers 10 1116 evidence that had been given in the Prior Actio
about the case of Ligur, which was a charge of miscenduct against
Verres in his Urban Praetorship.

In the second book (c. 1.) Cicero comes, as he says, to the real
business, to the case os Sicily and Verres’ three years' maladminis-
tration3 and this is the subject of the third, fourth, and fifth books also.
In the last four books Cicero confines himself 10 1116 proper matter of
the prosecution. But 116 still speaks of fresh evidence 10 be heard from
Sicilian witnesses (2. c. 33); though a great deal of evidence had been
given in the Prior Actio both by individuals and by those who were
commissioned to give evidence on behalf of Sicilian towns (2. c. 49).
There are many other passages 10 the same effect (2. c. 65), (2. c. '7 6,
‘tum quum eos ipsos produxero qui dederunt3' and 3. c. 9.) Cicero
also in these last four orations often refers to documentary evidence
then produced for the first time about the conduct of Verres in Sicily,
and makes his remarks on it (3. c. 10, and c. 17).

The matter then stands thus, as Cicero states it. After the speech
here called the Actio Prima, evidence was given both about the mal·
administration of Verres in Sicily, for which 116 was 011 his trial, and for
other previous miscenduct, 1101 111 Sicily, and for which he was not on his
trial. I do not understand why Cicero produced evidence in the Prior
Actio about matters which did not pertain to the prosecution that he
had undertaken3 but still this speech was delivered. The first book of
the Second Actio is wholly unconnected with the real matter of the pro-
secution. The speech aud the evidence referred to in it have no relation
to the charges on which Cicero undertook to be the prosecutor of Verres.
Though the Roman procedure gave very great licence to a prosecutor and
allowed him to say much, which he did not prove and sometimes could not
prove, of which Cicero’s orations furnish plenty of instanees, I do not
believe that such a speech as this De Praetura Urbana could have been
delivered, or that the presiding magistrate could have tolerated the produc-
tion of so much evidence which could lead to 110 conviction, when there was
