maxime ab injuriis nostrorum magistratuum remoti consuerant esse
praesidio foederis, hi tamen istius evertere statuam non dubitave-
runt. Qua abjecta basim tamen in foro manere voluerunt3 quod
gravius in istum fore putabant, si scirent homines statuam ejus a
Tauromenitanis esse dejectam, quani si nullam unquam positam
esse arbitrarentur. Tyndaritani dejecerunt in foro; et eadem de
causa equum inanem reliquerunt. Leontinis, misera in civitate
atque inani, tamen istius in gymnasio statua dejecta est. Nam
quid ego de Syracusanis loquar, quod non est proprium Syracusano·
rum, sed et illorum et commune conventus illius ac prope totius
provinciae? Quanta illic multitudo, quanta vis hominum conve-
nisse dicebatur tum quum statuae sunt illius dejectae atque
eversae? At quo loco? Celeberrimo ac religiosissimo, ante
ipsum Serapim in primo aditu vestibuloque templi. Quod nisi
Metellus hoc tam graviter egisset atque illam rem imperio edicto-
que prohibuisset, vestigium statuarum istius in tota Sicilia nullum
esset relictum.

Greek colony in Sicily (Thucyd. vi. 3), was traco the history of this divinity. He got

founded by the Chaleidians, three miles
south of a rock called Taurus. It was de-
stroyed by Dionysius, B.C. 403 (Diodorus,
xiv. 15). In B.c. 358 the remuant ofthe Nax-
ians were settled by Andromaehus not on the
ruins of the old toxwx, but on the Taurus,
which had been already occupied by the
Siculi and was called Tauromenium. The
place became flourishing and populous, an
evidence of which is the magnitude of thc
theatro, partly eut 111 the rock, which is
nearly entire, and capable of containing
many thousand persons.

Leontini-Q] This means ‘in Le‹›ntini,'
for ‘ Leontini' was the. name both of the
people and of the place, both 111 the Greek
aud the. Latin writers. The words ‘ misera
in civitate ' are explained by Lib. 3. c. 46.

sed et illorum ilc] The reading of this
passage is not certain, and various attempts
have been made to amend it. The text is
that of Zumpt. and it is intelligible. Cicero
says, “why should l speak of the Syra-
cusani 111 a matter which is not peculiar lo
them, but is both their all'air aud common
to that ‘ conventu& aud almost to the
whole province P”-‘ de Syracusis loquar '

a footing in Egypt, and kept it there till a
bold hand demolished his idol. Serapis is
said to be au importation into Egypt from
Pontus, Whether he came into Greece
and Sicily from Egypt, or was imported
direct, 1 do not know. Gibbon, c. 28, has
told his story.—A ‘ celeberrimus loeus ’ is
a much-frequented place. See Lib. 1. c. 26,

“ Colle sub aprico celeberrimus ilice lucus
Stabat et in ramis multa latebat avis,’'
Ovid, Am. iii. 5. 3,

where the poet might have said ‘ ereberri-
111115,’ for he does say it 111 another passage,
‘ creber arundinibus tremulis ibi surgere
lucus’ (Met. xi. 190). Thus the usage of
the language coutirms the conclusion as to
the relationship of ‘ creber ¹ and ‘ celebrisss

‘ Religiosissimo :’ Gaius (ii. 1) “ sacrae
sunt quae Diis superis consecratae suut;
religiosae, quae Diis manibus relictae suut.''
A ‘loeus' could be made “ religiosus ' by
bur-ring u dead body in it, “ 51 111111111 ejus
