512 IN O. VERREM

Romam quae apportata sunt ad aedem Honoris et Virtutis
itemque aliis in locis videmus. Nihil in aedibus, nihil in hortis
posuit, nihil in suburbano: putavit, si urbis ornamenta domum
suam non contulisset, domum suam ornamento urbi futuram.
Syracusis autem permulta atque egregia reliquit : deum vero nul-
lum violavit, nullum attigit. Conferte Verrem3 non ut hominem
cum homine comparetis, ne qua tali viro mortuo fiat injuria sed
ut pacem cum bello, leges cum vi, forum et jurisdictionem cum
ferro et armis, adventum et comitatum cum exercitu et victoria
conferatis.

aedem Honoris rhu] An ‘ aedes ’ of
Honor was outside the Porta Collina (Cic.
De Leg. ii. 23). Cicero mentions both
temples in the De Natura Deorum (11. 23) :
“ vides Virtutis templum, vides Honoris a
M. Marcello renovatum, quod multis ante
annis erat bello Ligustico a Q. Maximo
de(licatnm.” There seems to be an error
111 ‘ Porta Collina? See 0. 55.

suburbano ι] ‘a residence near Rome.’
The Romans used the word as 3 noun.

55. Aedis] Zumpt in his larger edition
1135 ‘aedis,’ perhaps the genuine form of
the nominative. ‘Aedis ³ R, G 1 2.

quae ab isto . . videatur] This is quoted
by Gellius, ii. 6.

retineret‚] Zumpt admires that all the
better MSS. have ‘ contineret.’ Klotz has
‘ contineret.5 We must follow the worse
here. Gellius has ‘retineret.’

The history of this adventurer, who

putavit, si urbi-5] Rightly explained by
Hotniann: the absence of decoration in the
house of Marcellus would be a proof of his
integrity3 and the character of the man
would be an honour to the state.

adventum] This is a kind of technical
word, or at least a word which, like many
Roman words of common use, obtained also
a particular signification. It is the ‘ad-
vent,' or coming of the governor here (sce
Lib. 1. c. 19). The word appears in a like
sense on Roman imperial medals, as on
one of Hadrianus, which has the legend
ADYENTVS Ave. This mcdal belongs to
the second year of Hadrian, or at least his
second consulship, and commemoratos his
arrival at Rome from the East, where he
was when Trajan died.

made himself a king, is chiefly told by
Diodorus and Polybius. This picture ap-
pears to have been on panels of wood.
There are many coins of Agathocles. One
of them, a common bronze coin, has a female
head with the legend ΣΩΤΕῙΡΑ, and on
the reverse ΑΓΑΘΟΚΛΕΟΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΟΣ.

profana fecisset] By the law of war
they had become the property of the con-
querors, and lost their sacred quality. See
Mam-ob. Sat. iii. 9, 011 the ‘ evocatio.5

illa jam] ‘ Illa ’ refers to ‘lias tabulas.5
Verres, by virtue of the long peace and
fidelity of the SyracusanS‚ had received all
these works of art as things consecrated to
the service of religion. Ε et Lagg. have
‘ accepisset :' R3 ‘ cepisset,’ which is a mis·
take.
