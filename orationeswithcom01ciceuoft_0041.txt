DIVINATIO. 23
Magnum crimen, ingens pecunia, furtum impudens, injuria non
ferenda. Ego hoc uno crimine illum condemnem necesse est: tu,
Caecili, quid facies P Utrum hoc tantum crimen praetermittes an
objicies? Si objicies, idne alteri crimini dabis quod eodem tempore
in eadem provincia tu ipse fecisti? Audebis ita accusare alterum
ut quo minus tute condemnere recusare non possis Ρ Sin praeter-
mittes, qualis erit ista tua accusatio, quae domestici periculi metu
certissimi et maximi criminis non modo suspicionem verum etiam
mentionem ipsam pertimescat 2> Emptum est ex S. C. frumentum
ab Siculis praetore Verre, pro quo frumento pecunia omnis soluta
non est. Grave est hoo crimen in Verrem, grave me agente3 te
accusante nullum. Eras enim tu quaest0r3 pecuniam publicam tu
tractabas3 ex qua, etiamsi cuperet praetor, tamen ne qua deductio
fieret magna ex parte tua potestas erat. Hujus quoque igitur cri-
minis te accusante mentio nulla fiet. Silebitur toto judicio de max-
imis et notissimis illius furtis et injuriis. Mihi crede, Caecili, non
¹ potest in accusando socios vere defendere is qui cum reo criminum
societate conjunctus est. Mancipes a civitatibus pro frumento
pecuniam exegerunt. Quid, hoc Verre praetore factum est solum?

domestici] ‘ your own? So Cicero writes
‘domesticum ineom1nodum,' ‘a man's own
less?

Emptum est, effu] A quantity of corn
had been purchased in Sicily by an order of
the Senate, probably for the vietualling of
Rome, after thc fashion of the time 3 and
it was not all paid for; and Caecilius, as
the quaestor, had the handling of the
money. Klotz remarks that this charge
1115015 a feeble onc; 1“01· the quaestor was
bound to obey the praetor's orders. He
had indeed the care of the money, and
must account for it to the Aerarium ; but
110 must obey the orders of the praetor as
to payment or non-payment. He quotes,
in support of this, a passage of Polybius
(vi. 12), to prove that the quaestor at
Rome must make the payments whieh the
consul ordered him to make. But this is
not quite decisive. It might 110, that in
the case of corn purchased for Rome he
was absolutely bound to pay, and that he
was provided with money for the purpose.
Ilowcver this may be, it 15 true, as Klotz
remarks, that Cieero's expression, ‘ magna
ex parte tua potestas erat,' 15 but a l'eeble
way of allirmiug· the quaestam-’s respon-
sibility in 1110 matter. But Klotz, in 1115
zeal to defend Caecilius, goes a little too

far. 110 argues, from what Cicero says at

the end of the next chapter, that tho
authority of the praetor over the quaestor
was supreme. But it (1005 not follow, that
if Verres could prevent Caecilius from doing
wrong, he could prevent him from doing¹
right: if he 0011111 prevent him froin
paying money when he ought not, or from
mis-applying money, it does not follow that
he could prevent him from paying it
when he ought, or from applying it pro-
perly. Again, 111 the matter of the Man-
eipes at the end of this chapter, Cicero
says that Caecilius eould have 111-0101110ιί
the fraud. W'hether 11115 15 true or not, it
makes Cicero consistent.

Maneipes] Here they are 1110 sarmers
(fermiers generaux), who paid a 50111 01“
money to the state for the right of levying-r
certain imposts. ‘Manceps' 11101105 gene—
rally a person who purchases any thing
from the state, or agrees to pay a certain
sum by way of farm or the like (Festus v.
Manceps; and Aet. ii. Lib. 1. 0. 515 l'ro
S. Roscio Am. 0. 8). Τ11050 Maneipes paid
a certain sum for 1110 right of vollen-ling
certain 1111110515 111 kind, but not to take.
money instead (Act. ii. Lib. 3. 0. 71),
