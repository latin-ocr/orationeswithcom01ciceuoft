74 IN O. VERREM

aut deponere aut recipere aut accipere aut polliceri aut sequestres
aut interpretes corrumpendi judieii solent esse, quique ad hanc rem
aut potentiam aut impudentiam suam professi sunt, abstineant in
hoc judicio manus animosque ab hoc scelere nefario.

XIII. Erit tum consul Hortensius curn summo imperio et
potestate, ego autem aedilis, hoc est, paulo amplius quam privatus;
tamen hujusmodi haec res est, quam me acturum esse polliceor, ita
populo Romano grata atque jucunda ut ipse consul in hac eausa-
prae me minus etiam, si fieri possit, quam privatus esse videatur.
Omnia non modo commemorabuntur, sed. etiam expositis certis
rebus agentur, quae inter decem annos, posteaquam judicia ad
senatum translata sunt, in rebus judicandis nefarie flagitioseque
facta sunt. Cognoscet ex me populus Romanus quid sit quam-
obrem, quum equester ordo judicaret annos prope quinquaginta
continuos, nullo judice equite Romano judicante ne tenuissima
quidem suspicio acceptae pecuniae ob rem judicandam constituta
sit; quid sit quod judiciis ad senatorium ordinem translatis sub-
lataque populi Romani in unumquemque vestrum potestate Q.

‘Polliceri' is not so clear. It is mis-
explained by Klotz, who makes it signify
the promise of the ‘judex' to him who
proposes the bribe to him 3 but this is not
the meaning of ‘ polliceri ' (note on Divin.
c. 1). Cicero's words are general, and yet
particular enough, vm'thout descending to a
minute examinatior] of them. ‘Polliceri'
here means, as usual, to make a proffcr,
and it may mean either a proffer of the
‘judices ’ 10 sell their votes, or a proffer of
the corrupter to buy the votes. ‘ Seques-
tres ’ are the persons 111 whose hands money
is deposited, to be afterwards distm'buted
among the bribed 3 and ‘ interpretes' were
the managers and brokers of the bargain.

13. eum summo imperio ²5⁶²] The eon-
suls had both ‘imperium ¹ and ‘potestas ;'
and they had the ‘ summum imperium.'
Some ‘magist1·atus,' the tribunes, for 111-
stance, had only ‘ potestas.5 We can say
‘ consularis potestas,' or ‘ tribunicia potes-
tas ³ (c. 15), and ‘imperium consulare,’ but
not ‘ imperium tribunicium? ‘ Summo cum
imperio ³ could be applied to a ‘ propraetor’
in his provincial administration, for he had
full power, both civil and military (Cic. Ad
Q. Fr. i. 1, 2). The ‘summum imperium'
included the highest judicial authority, in
the Roman sense (Dig. 2. tit. 1, de J uris-
dictione). See Excursus iv.

sed etiam . . . [wantum] This is one of

those Roman expressions which are very
difficult to translate, owing to their having
a generality, for which we have nothing
corresponding. The orator says, ‘every
thing shall be, 1 do not say simply told,
but, after certain matters are set forth,
every thing shall, in every possible way, be
brought before you, which,’ ἀρ. Comp.
Div. c.12, “causa non solum exponenda
sed etiam graviter copioseque agenda est,''
&c.

decem annom] Ten yearS, 111 round
numbers, since Sulla transferred the ‘ju-
dicia' to the senate. The real time was
somewhat above eleven years. The ‘ prope
quinquaginta annos' is also an exaggera-
tion, for the real time was about forty-one
years during which the Equites exercised
the J udicia [uider the Lex Sempronia of
C. Gracchus

nullo judice effen] This is the reading of
al] the MSS. Zumpt and Iordan have ‘in
nullo judice? ‘ Locus corruptus,' says
Orelli. Klotz points it thus: ‘nullo judice,
equite Romano judicante.5 The simplest
change would be to write ‘ nulla.’ Madvig
proposes ‘in nullo judice ne tenuissima?
ἅς.

sublataque . . potestate] As Asconius
explains it, the appe-al to the ‘populus,'
that is, to the ‘ tribuni plebis.'
