ΙΙ. JUDICIA.

Tm terms J us Publicum and J us Privatum were used by the Romans
to express the whole body of law which exists in a state. The opposition
between J us Publicum and J us Privatum is shown by the words of
Ulpian (Dig. 1. 1. 1. ξ 2); “Publicum jus est quod ad statum Rei
Romanae spectat, privatum quod ad singulorum utilitatem.” (Comp.
J ustin. Inst. 1. 1. 1.) The J us Publicum has the State for its object,
the political organization of a people- The J us Privatum comprehends
the whole of the legal relations in which individuals stand to one
another. The two divisions are distinct enough and intelligible, what-
ever objections may be made to the terms by which they are designated.
The notion of a State is not indeed limited to the department of Law3
but one of the purposes of the existence of a State is to give reality to
the idea of Law. And this is effected in two ways. If an individual’s
rights are invaded, the State protects him and gives him redress3 and
the mode by which this is accomplished comprehends the rules of Civil
Procedure. The State asso exercises its activity without respect to the
interests of individuals by inflicting punishment for the violation of
positive Law: and the rules according to which this is done comprehend
Criminal Law and Crimina] Procedure. The Romans comprehended
under J us Publicum, both Civil Procedure, Criminal Law and Criminal
Procedure. The activity of the State, by means of those to whom
power is delegated‚ is as manifest in Civil Procedure as it is in Criminal
Procedure. But the direct object in Civil Procedure is to establish the
right of an individual or to give him compensation for a wrong: in
Criminal Procedure the direct object is the punishment of an individual
for the general interest.

Publicum J us comprehended the Law which concerned religion (J us
Sacrum); and if ever J us Publicum and Sacrum are opposed to one
another, it is only for the purpose of marking the distinction between the
rules of Law that relate to things which concern religion, and to things
which do not concern religion.

One of the Leges Valeriae declared that no Roman Magistratus should
have the power of putting to death or whipping a Roman citizen without
