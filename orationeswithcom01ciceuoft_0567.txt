servitii] The number of slaves. This
is a collective term, as in c. 4, ‘ moveri ali-
quot locis servitium suspicor.'

qffendit‚] Some of the old editions have
‘ostenditur,’ a conjecture. Naugerius re-
stored the reading of the dett„ ‘offen-
ditur 3² but Hervagius, having got a MS. of
a better family, wrote ‘offendit’ R 3,
codd. Lamb. have ‘offendit‚' and Iordan.
Klotz and Orelli, who have ‘offendit,'
adopt Madvig-'s explanation, that ‘ servos'
is to be supplied, and we are to consider
that Cicero is speaking of the season in
which the slaves, 011 account of the op-
pressive labour, are most easily excited to
rebellion. Zumpt, following the opinion
of Lambinus, takes ‘offenditur' to be the
true reading, and to have the sense of
‘ deprehenditur? But, as Madvig observes,
Zumpt cannot produce an instance of this
use of ‘offenditur.' Madvig considers all
the passage, down to ‘non impedit,' to
refer to the slaves, and that Cicero enu-
merates all those things which at this season
of the year could chiefly excite the slaves to
a rising. This passage is (1111101111, and, as
opinions may differ about it, 1 give Madvig-'s
full interpretation: “Scilicet haec omnia
ad servos referenda sunt, enumeranturque
ea, quac servos ad bellum hoc potissimum
anni tempore concitare possunt; quod nc
oriatur, ideo praetor provinciam obire tum
solet: aestate familiae congregabantur ;
itaque occultae conjurationis occasio erat ;
magnitudo servitii perspiciebatur3 ergo vi-
res fiduciam dabant ; labor messis gravissi-
mus erat ς itaque animi offensi et irati, ad
arma proni 3 frumeuti copia parata hellan-
tibus, teinpus anni rebus gerendis uptum.'’
Zumpt has ‘et frumenti,' but ‘et’ is omitted
by the best MSS. ς and the omission makes
the sense plainer. Cicero says that it is the
custom of the praetors to travel through
Sicily particularly at the time when all
the corn is collected at 1110 threshiug.
floors(tu1u . . . quum . . . frumenta sunt) ς
when the harvest is over, and the grain is
to be got out, So far is plain. He then

adds a number of circumstances which
would be concurrent with this period, and
they are alleged as reasons (‘ quod et,' 810.)
for the circuit being made at this season.
I-think that ‘frumenti . . . impedit ³ apply
to the praetor. The words ‘ fiuniliae . . .
perspicitur' of course apply to the slaves :
they are collected at the ‘ areae,' and their
numbers can be seen 3 they may be counted,
if necessary. There remains ‘labor . . .
offendit? If it is supposed that this applies
to the slaves, we may observe that the
getting out of the corn is not so laborious
as cutting it ; unless we suppose that the
slaves threshed it in some way, and 1
know no evidence that they did. Ι don't
see why the sight of the corn should sug-
gest insurrection. If the slaves rose, they
could not carry the corn with them. Nor
do Ι 500 that the time of the year was
seasonable for insurrection. If the slaves
of each estate were at the threshing-tloor,
those of one estate would not see those of
another estate, and as the slaves of each
estate were in one place, they would be
watched and all their movements would be
50011. The danger of insurrection would
be greatest when thc slaves had little to
do. If the summer was favourable for an
insurrectiou, it was also favourable for
suppressing it, by bringing together all
the force that the island had. The winter
would bc the best time sor the slaves to
riso, when the counuunicatious were diffi-
01111 for every body, but still practicable
for men resolved to make a rising. 1 do
not believe that Madvig's interpretation of
‘labor operis maxime ofl'endit’ is true,
But it is very difficult to suggest what is
meant.
