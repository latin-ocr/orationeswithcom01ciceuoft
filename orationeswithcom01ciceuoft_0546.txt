528 IN O. VERREM

LXIV. Mos est Syracusis ut, si qua de re ad senatum referatur,
dicat sententiam qui velit: nominatim nemo rogatur3 et tamen, ut
quisque aetate et honore antecedit, ita primus solet sua sponte
dicere, idque a ceteris ei conceditur: sin aliquando tacent omnes,
tum sortito coguntur dicere. Quum hic mos esset, refertur ad
senatum de laudatione Verris. In quo primum, ut aliquid esset
morae multi interpellantjhde Ser:² Peducaeo, qui de illa civitate
totaque provincia optime meritus essen-sueyse antea quum audissent
ei negotium facessitum, quumque eum publice pro plurimis ejus et
maximis meritis*⁴ laudare cuperent, a C. Verre prohibitos esse: ini-
quum esse, tametsi Peducaeus eorum laudatione jam non uteretur,
tamen non id prius decernere quod aliquando voluissent quamquod
tunc cogerentur.w ‘Conclamant omnes et approbant ita fieri opor-
tere. Refertur de Peducaeo. Ut quisque aetate et honore ante-
cedebat, ita sententiam dixit ex ordine. Id adeo ex ipso senatus
consulto cognoscite3 nam principum sententiae perscribi solent.

‘ adeo ' seems plain, and is consistent with
its etymon ‘ad' and ‘eo' the pronoun.
It is used in the clause which strengthens
and exemplifies what has been said before.
‘ Id adeo ’ occurs in the next chapter
(c. 64), where it may mean ‘accordingly'
and here too. See also Lib. 5. 0. 4. We
read 111 Terence, Phorm. iv. 3. 40, ‘ Quod
dixi adeo ei :’ ‘ That is exaetly what I said
to him?

64. Mos est Syracusis] Cicero explains
this because the Roman fashiou was diffe-
rent. The Roman senators were called on
according to a certain rule. If there were
‘consules designati,' they spoke first. If
there were no ‘ consules designati,’ the con-
suls called on the ‘princeps senatus‚’ and
then ou such persons as he thought proper,
but yet in such wise as to call on a ‘con-
sularis' before a ‘praetoriuS,’ and so on.
Sec Becker, Handbuch, 11. 2, p. 425.

idque α ceteris] ‘ Itaque a ceteris ³ R 3,
Klotz, Iordan.-—‘ sin . . tacent τ’ ‘ sin . . ta-
ceant ' in the reprint of Zumpt, and I sup-
pose in his minor edition. In his larger
one he has properly taken the better read-
ing, ‘ sin . . tacent,' which Klotz also has.

ut aliquid esset morae] ¹ Ut eum diem
interpellatione eximerent,' Hotlnann. This
was done by some who were the friends of
Verres, or the tools of Metellus. There
were some ; for he sayS, c. 65, ‘ prope cunc-
tis sententiis? He does not sa)r au.

neyotiumfacessitum,] ‘ Reum esse fac-

tum’ (Manutius). He quotes a letter of
Cicero to Appius, iu which the same ex-
pression occurs. In Divin. 0. 14, the ex-
pression is ‘ne innocenti periculum faces-
seris? Peducaeus did not want their testi-
monial now, for either he had escaped a
prosecution or had been acquitted.

de Peducaeo] He was praetor of Sicily
in the years B.c. 76, 75, in the second of
which years Cicero was quaestor under
him. Zumpt supposes him to be the man
who is mentioned De Fin. ii. 18. He had
two 50115, 0110 of whom is called Sextus,
and is often named in Cicero's letters.
C. Sacerdos was praetor of Sicilyin Rc. 74 3
Verres in the years B.C. 73, 72, 71; and.
now, Rc. 70, L. Metellus was praetor.

Quod verba ⁶5⁶²] This was the Roman
formula for expressing the subject in de-
bate, and it was followed by the decision or
resolution as in the passage of Frontinus
De aquae duct. 0. 100 (cited by Halm):
“Quod Q. Aelius Tubero Paullus Fabius
Maximus coss. verba fecerunt de etc. de
ea re quid fieri placeret, de ea re ita cen-
suerunt placere huic ordini ’³ &c. There

are other examples in Frontinus De aquae ,

duct. See also c. 66, ‘quod . . verba fe-
eissem.¹

In Gellius (xv. 11) there is the Senatus-
consultum ‘ De philosophis et de rhetoribus
Latinis,’ of which this is the form: “ M.
Pomponius praetor senatum consuluit.
