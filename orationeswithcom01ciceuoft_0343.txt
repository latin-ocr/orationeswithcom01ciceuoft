AGT. ΙΙ. LIBER TERTIUS. 325

erat colono locatus: colonus quod decumanorum injurias ferre
non poterat ex agro profugerat. Verres in Xenonem judicium
dabat illud suum damnatorium de jugerum professione. Xeno
ad se pertinere negabat: fundum elocatum esse dicebat. Dabat
iste judicium, Si paret jugera ejus fundi plura esse quam colonus
esset professus, tum uti Xeno damnaretur. Dicebat ille non
modo se non arasse, id quod satis erat, sed nec dominum ejus esse
fundi nec locatorem: uxoris esse3 eam ipsam suum negotium

gerere : ipsam locavisse.

tiarius! Gaius, Dig. 19. 2. 25. ξ 6, “ap-
paret autem de eo nos colono dicere qui ad
pecuniam numeratam conduxit ; ahoquin
partiarius colonus quasi societatis jure et
damnum et lucrum cum domino fundi par-
titur.’' This is the metayer system.

The ‘coloni' of the later empire are
quite different from these ‘ coloni ' of Ci-
cero's time, who were simply tenant far-
mers. There are only two passages in the
writings of the great Roman jurists in
which these later ‘ coloni ' are mentioned.
One is an excerpt from Marcian, Dig. 30.
5. 112 ,· and the other is a rescript of Alex-
ander Severus, of A.D. 225 (Cod. Just. 8.
52. 1). There are passages in which the
‘ coloni Caesaris ¹ are mentioned, which, as
Savigny observes, may apply as well to the
common free tenant farmers, as to ‘coloni'
in the later sense. Nobody will suppose
that the ‘ colonus aratorque vester' of this
oration (c. 23) means any thing more than
‘colonus’ in its original sense. On the
later ‘ coloni,’ see Savigny, Vermischte
Schriften, vol. 11., ‘ Ueber den Riimischeu
Colonat,' a reprint of his essay, with sup-
plementary renmrks.

A‘eno] The Greek name is Ξένων.
The best MSS„ including V, have ‘ Xeno'
for the nominative. thether the Romans
wrote it so or not, is uncertain. If we
write ‘Xeno‚' we ought to write ‘8010ss
and Zumpt observes that it is so in Cicero
³ De Republica, ii. 1. But Ι find it written
‘ tum Draco, tum Solon?

The name, ‘ Xenophon ’ belongs to 11 dif-
ferent class, for the crude form is Xeno-
phont.

fundum elocatum]
this is the reading of all his MSS„ but
that some of the old editions have ‘ locu-
tum.’ He says it makes some diff-eremo,
that it is not mentioned to whom it was
let. 1f so, we should have presently
afterwards ‘elocavisse' instead of ‘loca-
visse.'

Zumpt says that

Defendebat Xenonem homo summo

Dabat iste judicium] Klotz has ‘dat
iste,' δια, following V, from which he also
adopts the vicious reading ‘ si pareret ' for
‘ si paret :’ ‘ si pareret ' is also the reading
of B N. Iordan also has ‘ pareret! Lg.
29. 42 F have ‘paret.' Garatoni, in his
note on Divin. c. 17, doubts about the
form ‘si paret' here; that is, “possetne
atque adeo deberet ipsa formula, quo tem-
pore verbi in actu rerum profertur, etiam
in indirecta oratione servari '’ (Zumpt).
I don't see how the remark applies to this
passage ; and if it did, Ι conceive that
the formula would be given in its proper
terms.

The ‘ condemnatio ’ in the formula is as
extravagant as the instance in Lib. 2. c.
12, and so far helps to explain that chap-
ter. Xeno, who had no interest 111 the
land, for it was his wife's property, was to
pay the penalty of the alleged false return
of his wife’s tenant. And even if he had
been the owner, the case would have been
as bad, for the occupier of the 1111111, the
cultivator, was bound to make the return
(profiteri). And this was the detbnce of
Xeno. He had not cultivated the lund,
which was in itself enough (111 quod satis

.ernt); but more than that, he was not tho

owner (dominus) nor the lessor (locator),
hy which he means, I suppose, that he had
not let it for another, though ‘ locutor ' is
properly said of him who lets his own. In
fact, it was his wife’s property, 111111 she
was accustomed to look after her own
affairs (51111111 negotium gerere).—V and
Lg. 481mve, in place of ‘id quod satis:
the corrupt reading ‘id quod satum: a
variation hardly worth noticing, except
for the fnct that an editor could be found
to adopt it. Klotz reads ‘non arasse id,
quod sutum erat, sed’ διας and Halm
asks, ‘quidni scribitur quod salum erat
cum optimo V?’ 1 leave the reader to
111151151- this question.
