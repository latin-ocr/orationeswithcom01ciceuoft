SICILY. 631

Panhormum] So it stands in Harduiu's text, with the ‘ h.' This, of course, was the
Roman mode of writing. The Greek coins have the legend ΠΑΝΟΡΜΙΤΑΝ.

Solus] This word is in form like Selinus, and as the Romans said Hydruntum for
Hydrus, so they sometimes said Soluntum.

Himera] This is the city and river mentioned by Cicero, Lib. 2. c. 35. There is a
coin with the legend HIMERA, in Roman characters, for the R appears plain. The
face, on which the legend is, contains the figure of a eoek.

Ceplcaloeclis] There is a Greek coin, apparently of this place, m'th ΚΕΦ οι· ΚΕΦΑ
legible on it.

Alunlium] A Greek coin, of which I have a east, has the name ΑΛοΝΤΙΝ so far
legible. Perhaps Haluntium was also the Roman fashiou of writing this name.

Tyndaris] It is not known when Tyndaris became a colonia. There is a Greek coin
of Tyndaris with the head of a horse on one of the faces.

Latinae conditionis] Pliny mentions Centuripa or Centuripae, Netum, and Segesta,
as ⁵ Latinae conditionis,' that is, as possessing the J us Latinum or J us Latium, which
denoted a condition intermediate between that of Cives Romani and Peregrini. The
nature of this politic-al condition is explained by Saviguy (Entstehung der Latinitate,
Vermischte Schriften, vol. i.). But Cicero (Ad Att. xiv. 12) states that the J us Latium,
or, as he terms it, Latinitas, was given to all the Sieilians by the Dictator Caesar.
Cicero's words are ‘ Multa illis Caesar neque me invito, etsi Latinitas erat non ferenda ς’
the conclusion from which, Ι think, ought to be that Sicily did receive the Latinitas from
Caesar. If then Pliny means to liniit the Latinitas to these three towns, his state-
ment is unintelligible. Cicero further remarks, that after Caesar’s death M. Antonius
set up (fixit) a Lex, as passed in Caesar's lifetime, which gave the Roman civitas to the
Siciliaus ς but his words imply that it was a forgery. However, Diodorus (xiii. 35)
speaks of all the Sicilians being made Roman citizens, for such is the meaning of his
words ε πάντες οἵ Σικελιῶται τῆς Ῥωμαίων πολιτείας ἠξιώθησαν. How all this is to be
reeoneiled, I don't see.

Centuripini] The legend on the Greek coins is ΚΕΝΤΟΡΙΠΙΝΩΝ. 'rhough the
Greek name of Segesta is Ἐγεστα, the Greek coins have also ΣΕΓΕΣΤΑ.

Stipendiao·ii] The meaning of this term in Cicero has been explained. Its meaning
in Pliny may be the same ς but the condition of being Stipendiarii is inconsistent with
having the Roman civitas. Further, if an these states had become Stipendiarii‚ their
condition had been changed since Cicero’s time (Lib. 3. e. 6, note).

Assorini] Harduin says that· the legend on the coins of Assorus (apud Parutam) is
ΑΣΟΡΥ. ΧΡΎΣΑΣ. The coin that 1 have already referred to has the Roman legend
ASSORV and CRYSAS.

,ἄμμι-ἐπέ] The Agyrinenses of Cicero (Lib. 3. c. 52). Pliny uses a Greek form. The
coins appear to have ΑΙὛΡΙΝΑΙΩΝ.

Acestaei] The Aeestenses of the present text of Cicero (Lib. 3. e. 36).

Ασνεηεεε] They are not mentioned by Cicero. Their town was Acrae, on a losty
hill about twenty miles west os Syracuse. lt is now Acremoute, near Puluzzolo. There
is a description of the place iu the Museum of Classical Autiquities hy John Hogg.

Celarini] See Cicero, Lib. 3. c. -13.

Cae-mim] The name Cucyrum appears in Ptolemaeus als0; and no where else.

Emetimf] The name Ergetium occurs in Stephanus, and he gives Ergetini as the
Ethnie name. The name also occurs in Ptolemy with the aspirato, Sei-gentium, a
common variation iu the names of these Sieilian towns.

Echelle'ensex] Echetla is mentioned by Polybius (i. 15) and hy Diodorus (xx. 32).

Elini] ‘ MSS. Ediui ' (Harduin). He does not say why he does not follow the MSS.

Gelani] This Ethnic namo does not agree either with Cicero's form Gelenses, nor
with the Greek form Geloi. But Gelani may be a corrupted word.
