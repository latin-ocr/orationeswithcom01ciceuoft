518 ⁷ IN O. VERREM

iisset. Nunc enim quod scriptum est inani in basi declarat quid
fuerit, et id ablatum indicat.

Quid, signum Paeanis ex aede Aesculapii praeclare factum,
sacrum ac religiosum, non sustulisti? quod omnes propter pul-
chritudinem visere, propter religionem colere solebant. Quid, ex
aede Liberi simulacrum Aristaei non tuo imperio palam ablatum
est? Quid, ex aede Jovis religiosissimum simulacrum Jovis Im-
peratoris, quem Graeci Urion nominant, pulcherrime factum, nonne
abstulisti? Quid, ex aede Liberae parvum caput illud pulcherri-
mum, quod visere solebamus, num dubitasti tollere? Atque ille
Paean sacrificiis anniversariis simul cum Aesculapio apud illos

stood the inscription on the basis, he would
not have taken the statue. He does not
say that he would not have taken both of
them. That was nothing to his purpose.
He did take the statue and he left the
basis; and he certainly would not have
done this, says Cicero, if he had understood
a single Greek character. Zumpt has 001·-
rupted the text through misunderstanding
what Cicero meant to say. Zumpt refers
to the case in 0. 35, 115 confirmatory of his
emendation. In that case Verres carried
off the statue and afterwards had the basis
removed, because he knew what was on
it. If he had known what was on this
basis, he might have removed this basis
also, or have destroyed the inscription 3 but
he did not destroy it, and that fact fur-
nished Cicero with his argument, such as
it is. It is worth noting that Cicero
speaks (e. 35) of removing the basis (tol-
lendam locaverunt). The words ‘tollere’
and ‘sustulisset' are properly applied to
removing a basis 3 but if Zumpt's interpre-
tation of this passage (c. 57) 15 right, ‘sus-
tulisset ’ would apply to the ‘ epigramma.’
I do not deny that we might say ‘ tollere
epigramma 5' but if Cicero meant to speak
of simply destroying it, he would perhaps
have used another word; and if he meant
to speak of removing the 1111515, 115 111 0. 35,
110 would have said ‘ basim sustulisset?
Klotz retains ‘non‚' and says that nobody
would misunderstand the passage if it stood
thus, ‘ quod (epigramma) iste eruditus
homo . . . si intellexisset, certe non sustu-
lisset (signum poetriae).' Certainly nobody
could misunderstand this, but it is not
what Cicero wrote. Klotz has not under-
stood the use of ‘ quod‚' but still he makes
‘non sustulisset ³ apply to the statue, and
not to the ‘epigramma' See c. 66, note
on ‘ quod.'

58. Jovis Imperatoris‚] This name oc-

curs three times in this chapter without
any variation in the MSS. 3 and this is
sufficient, as Zumpt observes, to deter all
attempts at correction. It has been pro-
pos 5οᾶ 10 001· rect the word Imperator, not
because of any doubt about a ,Jupiter Im-
perator (Livy, vi. 29,- Ρ1111. Panegyr. 0. 5,
ed. G. H. Schaefer, a'nd the notes), but be-
cause of his being made the same with
Jupiter Urius, that 15, 1110 Zeus of favour-
able winds. The. proposed corrections of
Imperator, in order to make it suit the
meaning of Urius, are not worth record-
ing. Cicero says that there were three
statues of Jupiter Imperator, which were
great Works of art. There might be more
than three, but there were three which
were most conspicuous ς 0110 was the Mace-
donian, which, says Cicero, we have seen in
the capitol ς 11 second was at the entrance
of the Euxine, that is, at the eastern end
of the channe] of Constantinople, on the
Asiatic side; and the third was at Syra-
cuse. No Roman statue is mentioned 3 and
that which was formerly in the capitol
must be the Macedonian 51111110.- It all
comes to this then, that the Macedonian
statue, to which the Greeks gave the name
of Ζεὺς Οὕριος, 1110 Romans called by the
name of Imperator, · and it 15 11 mistake to
attempt to force out of Imperator, as
Zumpt does, by a false etymology, a mean-
ing which should correspond to that of
Urius.
