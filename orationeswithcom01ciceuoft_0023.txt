INTRODUOTION. 5

hurried to Sicily, and made the best use of his time, with the assistance
of L. Cicero, the son of his father’s brother. He traversed Sicily from
west to east, and was every where joyfully received, except at Syracuse,
where, however, he collected some important evidence, and at Messana,
where the city did not receive him with the hospitality to which a Roman
senator was entitled. (Act. ii. Lib. 4. c. 11.) Cicero travelled through
Sicily and collected his evidence in fifty days. (Act. i. c. 2.) He was
back again at Rome long before Verres and his friends expected him,
ready to commence the prosecution, with a crowd of witnesses, and a
mass of documentary evidence.

The trial was conducted under the presidency of M'. Acilius Glabrio,
the praetor urbanus, a man of integrity. In settling the list of judices
(judicum consilium) for the trial, Verres, being a senator, had the
power, according to the Cornelia Lex de Repetundis, of challenging
more than three judices3 those who were not senators could only chal-
lenge three. The advocates of Verres availed themselves of this privi-
lege, and Cicero mentions the names of six persons whom Verres rejected.
Cicero also rejected some of the judices. (Lib. 1. c. 7.) But the result
was, that the list as finally settled left Verres no hope of acquittal, for
his guilt was notorious, and the judiees were too honest to be bribed.
In Act. i. e. 10 Cicero names eight of the judiees, whom he calls ‘almost
the whole body ;' and from various passages in the orations the names of
twelve judices are collected. It may therefore be inferred that the
number was not much more than twelve.

Q. Metellus and Q. Hortensius were elected consuls for the following
year, B.o. 69, with the aid of the Sieilian gold of Verres, as Cice-ro
insinuates. The election was made before the trial began. (Act. i. c. 6.)
Μ. Metellus was elected a praetor for the following year, and the lot
gave him the duty of presiding at trials for the offenee of repetundae.
The object ef the friends of Verres was now to get the trial defer-red to
the next year, and to exclude Cicero from the curule aedileship by
bribing the voters. Cicero had thus a personal motivo for pushiug the
prosecution vigorously against a man whose stolen money was to deprive
him of the objectos his ambition. The friends of Verres had still hopes
that the trial might be thrown over to the next year, when Q. Metellus
and Q. Hortensius would be ιιι office. Μ. Metellus would be sitting u ι
the place of M’. Acilius Glab1i0‚aud a dishonest set of judices could bo
packed. Cicero was however elected curule aedile, after the delixeiy οῖ’
the Divinatio, as appears from the speech itself (Div. e 22), and befwm
the trial began (Act. 1. c. 9). The Pseudo-Asconius, in the argument
of the Divinatio, incorrectly calls him ‘ designatus aedilis.’ Cicero theu
was aedilis designatus when he conducted the prosecution, and llor-
