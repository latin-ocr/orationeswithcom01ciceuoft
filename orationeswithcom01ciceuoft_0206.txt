188 EDICTA MAGISTRAT UUM.

In the early history of Rome treaties were made between the Romans
and other people, by which, among other things, were regulated the modes
in which Romans and Peregrini, who had dealings with one another,
must settle their mutual clainis in case of dispute. Aforeigner at Rome,
or a Roman in a foreign country, must of necessity apply to the courts
of the country in which he was at the time. The persons at Rome who
settled disputes between a Roman and a Peregrinus were called Recupe-
ratores3 and at Rome we must assume that they would be Romans. i
They had not to apply the rules of Roman law to the cases which came
before them, for a Peregrinus could have none of the rights of a Roman
citizen, and none of the claims founded on those rights, the possession of
which was one of the exclusive characteristics of a citizen of Rome. The
functions of the Recuperatores were limited to the decision of such cases
as arose out of the dealings between Romans and Peregrini, to which the
strict rules of Roman law were not applicable. They must, therefore,
decide the cases that came before them according to the general notions
of equity, which all men have, or in accordance with such usages as they
found established and recognized by Peregrini, or Romans and Peregrini,
in their mutual dealings; and though Roman notions of law would
generally direct the Recuperatores in their judgments, the notions and
usages of foreigners also would exercise some influence on them, A set
of rules applicable to the dealings between Romans and Peregrini would
thus be formed and confirmed by the frequent application of them. As
Romans began to visit other countries more frequently for the purposes
of commerce and dealings (mercatores, negotiatores), and Peregrini
fiocked in greater numbers to Rome, the relations between them would
become more numerous and more complicated. This circumstance led
to the appointinent (Bc. 247> of a Praetor Peregrinus at Rome ‘qui
inter peregrinos et cives jus diceret,' for the Praetor Urbanus had
already sufficient to do; though there are instances, after the appoint-
ment of a Praetor Peregrinus, of both functions being exere-ised by one
Praetor (Liv. xxv. 33 xxxvii. 50). Many of these Peregrini were Socii,
who stood in some degree of subjection to Rome, and many of them
were Provinciales. All these people, though not Roman citizens, were
not in the condition of those nations with which Rome had no relations
at all ¹. They stood in such a relation to Rome that it was necessary to
provide for the administration of justice among them at Rome, between
them and Romans. The persons who were appointed by the Praetor to
hear and decide on such cases as these may have been generally Recu-
peratores3 but a simple Judex was also sometimes appointed both at
Rome and in the provinces.
