J US GENTIUM. 193

the ‘ naturalis rati0,’ as it is defined in the quotation at the beginning of
this note. WVhatever some of the later Roman law writers, Ulpian,
Tryphoninus, and Hermogenianus, may have written or thought of
Naturale J us, what they wrote or thought had no influence on Roman
Law, which had been developed practically and independently of any
Greek notions. Nor is the opposition between the J us Gentium of
Gaius and that of Cicero's time exactly such as Mr. Austin describes it,
for in Cicero Natura and J us Gentium are sometimes used indifferently.
The Romans used the word ‘naturalis ² in a great many cases as opposed
to ‘ civilis,’ as in the ‘ naturalis obligatio,’ which they view as founded on
the Jus Gentium. (See Savigny, System, 800„ Vol. i., Beilage i.)

These unlucky words ‘nature' and ‘natural' mislead modern law
writers, theologians, and philosophers, who often use them without
fixing any clear notion to them. If a man chooses to use them and
gives an intelligible meaning to them, and never deviates from that
meaning, when he uses them, we cannot blame him, except it be for
using words to which some people will give their own inexact meaning.

If any of the Greek schools of philosophy had any influence on
Roman Law, it was the Stoic; and it is certain that some of the
Roman jurists were Stoics. If they had any philosophy, there was
nothing else for a man of sense to take. But nobody, as far as I know,
has ever proved that the principles of Roman Law were in any way
affected by the Stoical or any other system of philosophy ¹.' The com-
pilers of J ustinian have certainly shown that they had very obscure
notions about the origin of Law; and there may have been law writers,
from whom Justinian’s workmen compiled, such as Ulpian, who at·
tempted a little philosophy in their Institutional writings. But if we
study the Excerpts of Ulpian in the Digest, we shall see that when he
is dealing with positive Law, he can write like a man of sense. The
Stoic philosophers, whose great practical rule of life was to live ac-
cording to nature, use that term in a very precise way, and not as it is
often used now, in a vague confused sense.
