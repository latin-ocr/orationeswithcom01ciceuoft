The Formula Octaviana. Lib. 3. c. 65.

THE Roman ‘praetor' gave relies to persons who had under compul-
sion' done any act which was against their interests, and it was a more
complete relief than was given in the case of other Restitutiones. The
injur-ed person received fourfold the amount of the loss or damage which
he had sustained3 and not only was the wrong-doer liable to make this
reparation, but every person who had derived a profit from the compul-
sory act, either directly or indirectly, was also liable to make reparation.
The remedy was by the ‘Actio quod metus causa’ (Dig. 4. tit. 2);
and its origin must be explained, according to Rudorff, by a reference
to the history of Repetundae. The Leges which relate to Repetundae
are enumerated in Excursus Ι.

The proceeding under the Lex Calpurnia (13.0. 149) was, in its mate-
rial part, a ‘ condictio,' that is, an action for the recovery of what was
claimed by the injured party 01· parties3 but the-‘litis aestimatio,’ or
assessment of the damage, was limited to the simple amount of what had
been wrongfully taken. But, though the proceeding was substantially
a ‘ condictio‚’ it was not conducted by a Legis Aetio per Condictionem,
for this had been abolished by the Lex Aebutia. The proceeding was
in the form of a Sacramenti Actio before the Praetor Peregrinus. The
Sacramentum contained a penalty for the illegal act3 whereas the
‘litis aestimatio,' which followed after judgment against the defendant,
gave to the complainant satisfactiou only to the amount of the loss
which he had sustained by the illegal act. The penalty in the Sacra-
mentum, it is assumed, came to the state, and, not like the ‘ Sponsionis
summa,’ to the successful party. The proceeding by the Sacramentum
was preserved in the Lex Junia, and also in the Servilia, according to
the restored text ¹ (l. 72—74). It also appears that if a man was con-
demned or acquitted 111 a Sacramenti Aetio, there could be no procecding
against him under the Servilia Lex; but the Lex excluded a man who
had been condemned in the §aeramenti Actio from acting as a ‘judex.’
The Sacramenti Actio of the Lex Calpurnia, and of the Lex Junia‚ was

¹ Thus in the restored text of the Lex Servilia, 11111· 23 : “ quei de pecunia capta con-
demnatus fuerit ant quod 1-11111 eo lege Calpurnia aut lege Jnnia sacramento ιιι-1111118111,
aut quod 11. l. nomen delatum siet.''
