292 IN O. VERREM

quam in luto demersam esse in litura? Sic habent se tabulae,
judices, ut videtis. Quid exspectatis? quid quaeritis amplius? Tu
ipse, Verres, quid sedes? quid moraris? nam aut exhibeas nobis
Verrutium necesse est aut te esse Verrutium fateare. Laudantur
oratores veteres, Crassi illi et Antonii, quod crimina diluere dilu-
cide, quod copiose reorum causas defendere solerent. Nimirum
illi non ingenio solum his patronis sed fortuna etiam praestiterunt. .
Nemo enim ita tum peccabat ut defensioni locum non relinqueret:
nemo ita vivebat ut nulla ejus vitae pars summae turpitudinis esset
expers: nemo ita in manifesto peccatu tenebatur ut, quum impu-
dens fuisset in facto, tum impudentior videretur si negaret. Nunc
vero quid faciat Hortensius [patronus] Ρ Avaritiaene crimina fru-
galitatis laudibus deprecetur ⁸? At hominem flagitiosissimum, libidi-
nosissimum, nequissimumque defendit. An ab hac ejus infamia,

Verres. There is a delicious note of Hot-
mann on this passage, which I copy out,
for fear that it should be lost: “extremi-
tatem. Sumpta videtur translatio a bestia
cujus cauda extra cubile extans index est
eam ibi delitescere.” Did Hotmann ever
see a bea-st in its ‘ cubile,’ with its tail on
the outside, keeping watch instead of the
head P Cicero could not refrain from a joke
011 the name of Verres, on which Nannius
acutely remarks: “festive autem Verrem
caudatam fecit, alludens ad id quod Verres
suem significat.'’ There is however an
objection to this explanation, for a pig’s
tail is too short to trail in the mud. But
this difficulty may be removed by comparing
another passage, 111 which Verres is a hog
wallowing in the mire (Lib. 4. c. 15).
There is a reading ‘ codam? The reading
of Klotz, ‘ Verrinam ³ for ‘ Verris,' is an im-
provement, and what is intended in V, the
reading of which is ‘ Verris nam?
exhibeas] ‘ Exhibere ³ is a word of art,
which means to produce for various pur-
poses. The title of the Digest (10. 4), Ad
exhibendum, is the best comment upon it.
The following passage from Gaius (Dig.
10. tit. 4. s. 13) will explain the text: “
liber homo detineri ab aliquo dicatur, in-
terdictum adversus eum qui detinere dici-
tur de exhibendo eo potest quis habere.’'
The person who detained the free man was
obliged to produce him, that the question
of freedom might be tried. This ‘inter-
dictum’ was like the English writ of
Habeas Corpus. See also Dig. 48.*tit. 3,
De Custodia et exhibitione reorum, an in-
structive title, from which we learn that
accused persons could be out on bail, but

the bail must produce them or pay (s. 4) :
“ si quis reum criminis, pro quo satisdedit,
non exhibuerit, poena pecuniaria plectitur.'’
We have the name ‘ exhibit' in chancery
proceedings, which is the Roman name, but
not the thing.

Crassi . . et Antonii,] The orators M.
Antonius and L. Licinius Crassus.

crimina diluere clilucide‚] ‘ Diluere '
means literally ‘ to take away by washing.'
Cicero adds ‘dilucide,' as if there might
be some connexion between the two words,
but he is merely playing on the sound.

nemo ita vivebat . . . negaret] These
words are quoted by Gellius, xiii. 20, who
observes that he found ‘peccatu' written
‘ in uno atque altero antiquissimae fidei
libro Tironiano 3' and he defends the form
‘ peccatu ² by like instanees. ‘ Peecatu' is
also in Lg. 42.

At hominem] This passa-ge is thus quoted
by Gellius (vi. 16), “ N unc vero quid faciat
Hortensius? Avaritiaene crimina, &c. An
hominem . . defendat,'’ which variation may
be either owing to the carelessness of Gel-
lius, in not looking further, or to his copy-
ists; for one MS. has ‘at.’ It is an in-

si stance however of the care that we should

take in adopting the readings of single
passages which are quoted by ancient
writers; for they were often misquoted.
Here the context dis pl 01 es the reading 111
the text of Gellius. As to the omission of
‘patr'onus, the text of Gellius cannot be
decisive ,- but ‘'patronus is only' 111 Lg. 42
