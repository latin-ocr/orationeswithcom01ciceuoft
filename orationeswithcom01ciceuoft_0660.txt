640 SICILY A ROMAN PROVINOE.

excurrant, ubi libenter negotium gerant3 quos illa partim mercibus
suppeditandis cum quaestu compendioque dimittit, part-im retinet ut
arare, ut pascere, ut negotiari libeat, ut denique sedes ac domicilium
collocare'' (Lib. 2. c. 3). Under these circumstances Sicily was pro-
bably the best cultivated country in Europe iu the time of Cicero. The
amount of produce raised on the fertile lands of Leontini has already
been discussed (Excursus Vl).

Cicero says nothing of the ‘ pecuarii ’ in these orations beyond men-
tioning them as one of the industrious classes in Sicily. The pasture
lands were probably nearly all Roman property3 and the ‘ pecuarii'
paid a sum of money (scriptura) for the pasturage of their fiocks. The
‘ scriptura ' in Italy and in the provinces was let by the censors at Rome.
This cannot be considered as a tax, but as a rent, like the money paid in
some of the Australian colonies of England for pasture licences. ‘⁶ In
Australia the flock-owners hold immense tracts on lease from the govern-
ment at a trifling sum, and a tax of so much a head on sheep and cattle.’'
The ‘ scriptura ’ was one of the oldest sources of Roman revenue. Sicily
produced a great amount of wool and skins; and in the Italic or Max-sic
war it sed, clothed, and armed the troops of Rome (Lib. 2. c. 2). The
‘ scriptura ' was farmed by Publicani, and in the time of Verres it hap-
pened that the same company (societas) farmed both the ‘scriptura’
and the ‘portoria’ (Lib. 2. c. 70). ‘⁶ The censors let also for pasture,
forests, coppice, osier-beds‚ such as those of the Silva Scantia or Sila,
the osier-beds of Minturnae3 and the tooth of the fiocks is the remote
cause of the almost general denudation of the Apennines, which at the
present day is so painful to look on, and which must have produced on
the Italian peninsula hygrometric or thermometric changes which have
been appreciable for a period of two thousand three hundred years ‘’
(Dureau de la Malle, ii. 445 ³).

The ‘portorium ’ or charge upon articles exported was a ‘vicesima’ or
twentieth, probably of their declared value. Cicero had no occasion to
speak of import duties in Sicily3 but perhaps we may assume that they
were equal to those on exports. Verres defrauded the Publicani by
exporting his plunder largely from Sicily (Lib. 2. c. 74, 75); among
which there was honey, sofas for dining-rooms‚ and eloth of Malta, all
which ought to have paid duty.

³ This remark applies of course to Italy. I give it simply as it is, without comment.
-It is said (Statistiqucdu Departcment dc la Vicune, An X. p. 58) that one of the most
active causes of the rapid destruction of the forests in France was the great quantity of
goats kept by the country people. Goats increased prodigiously after the revolution.
These niiscliicvous auiinals browscd not only on the hcdges and the foi-ests, but also
dcvourcd thc buds of the young planias, and soon killed them. The Same coniplaint is
made in the Statistique du Departement de l'Allier, An X.
