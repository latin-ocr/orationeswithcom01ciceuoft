DIVINATIO. 37

XIX. Ac vide quid differat inter meam opinionem et tuam. Tu
quum omnibus rebus inferior sis, hac una in re te mihi anteferri putas
’ oportere, quod quaestor illius fueris: ego, si superior ceteris re-
bus esses, hanc unam ob causam te accusatorem repudiari puta-
rem oportere. Sic enim a majoribus nostris accepimus, praetorem
quaestori suo parentis loco esse oportere; nullam neque justiorem
neque graviorem causam necessitudinis posse reperiri quam con-
junctionem sortis, quam provinciae, quam officii, quam publici
muneris societatem. Quamobrem si jure posses eun] accusare,
tamen, quum is tibi parentis numero fuisset, id pie facere non
posses: quum vero neque injuriam acceperis et praetori tuo peri-
culum crees, fatearis necesse est te illi injustum impiumque bellum
inferre conari. Etenim ista quaestura ad eam rem valet ut elabo-
randum tibi in ratione reddenda sit quamobrem eum cui quaestor
fueris accuses3 non ut ob eam ipsam causam postulandum sit ut
tibi potissimum accusatio detur. Neque fere unquam venit in con-
tentionem de accusando qui quaestor fuisset quin repudiaretur.

prosecuting his praetor, even if he had
sustained the greatest wrongs from him z if
he had received none, to prosecute him was
a crime. He concludes thus : ‘ Do you
think that there is any of these judiees who

in this contest with me without any blame
at all by being rejected as the prosecutor,

bear if you were appointed the prosecutor ‘2³'
Cicero says of M. Antonius, after 110 had
been addressing the peoplc, ‘ turpissime . .
discessit' (Ad Div. xii. 3). Comp. c. 22,
‘ ut turpissime . . discedat.'

parentis numero] He. has just said
‘parentis loco.' The Romans wrote both

Lib. 2. 0. 53, Cicero writes ‘numero et

place of a father, you could not do it 000-
sistently with tilial duty (pie).’ Cicero says

pium ’ unless declared according to the .Ῐο5·
Feciale, with certain solcnmities. Caecilius
is represented as a quaestor declaring an
‘injustum et impium bellum ' against his
praetor.
