Ni furtis] Servilius, it must be sup-
posed, had talked of the thefts of Verres 3
and Verres, in order to punish him, re-
solved to charge Servilius with theft.
Nobody had any demand upon Servilius,
and no charge to make against him (quum
ageret nemo, nemo postularet). Verres
compelled him to make a ‘sponsio' with
his own ‘ lictor,' the effect of which was to
try the question whether Servilius was a
thief or not; rather a singular way of
dealing with a man’s character, when there
was no charge against him. The form of
the ‘ sponsio,' in this case, as Rost explains
it, would be this: “Servus or Lictor:
Spondesne, Servili, HS duo millia, si tu
(quod ego affirmo et tn negas) furiis
quaestum facis? Servilius: Spondeo, τί
&c. Tum Servilius, Tu vero, lictor, spon-
desne, ni ἆυ. Lictor: Spondeo, ΜΨ &c-
This explanation of Rost's is adopted by
Orelli, but his adoption of it adds nothing
to the authority.

But we must distinguish between the
direct form of the ‘ sponsio,’ and the form
in which it is quoted. ln (laius (iv. 93)
we have an example of the direct form:
“provocamus adversarium tali sponsione:
Si homo qno de agitur cx jure Quiritium
meus est, sestertios xxv nummos darc
spondes ?'' The auswer would hc ‘ Spon-
deo! The c‹n·respomling direct form in
the passage of Cicero would he this chal·
lenge to Servilius, “Si furtis quaestum
facis, 11 millia mnmnum dare spondes P''
Servilius would not say ‘Spondeo‚' but
Verres tried to coinpel him to answer
(sponsionem tacere). lf the form in the
direct ‘sponsio ' was ‘ si . . . non’ with the

indicative, it was in the indirect ‘si . . .
non' with the subjunctive (Pro Quintio, c. 8.
27). But in affirmative ‘sponsiones‚' when
reported indireetly, the form ‘ ni ' is always
used, and not ‘si.' Huschke, quoted by
Keller (Sernestr. i. p. 38), gives a reason for
it. The words in legal formulae must not
be measured by the ordinary rules of the
Latin language. They are often anti-
quatcd modes of expression, which differ
from the forms in daily use. I take ‘ni’
in this formula to mean what Keller sng-
gests (ob nicht) : and the simple translation
of the text will be: ‘he eompels him to
make a Sponsio to the amount of, &cn—
If he was not enriching himself by thest.’
The question raised was, If he was not a
thief3 or, whether he was not a thies : just
as if the form had been ‘ Furtisnc quaestum
faceret) This explanation is equally appli-
cable to the passage in Lib. 3. c. 59, where
‘ sponsionem facere ’ applies to the ‘ stipu-
lator? The ‘ sponsio ' being made, it may
be generally referred to as containing the
matter, ‘ 11· so and sois not the case! Thus
Cicero says (e. 59), ‘Sponsio est, ni te'
ἀοι the ¹ sponsio,' that is, the question to
which ‘spondeo' had been answcrcd, in-
volved the question, ‘ If Apronius did not
say that you arc his partner in the Decu-
mae P’ So in another passage Cicero writes,
“ Sponsione me, Ni Esquilina introisset,
homo promptus lacessivit,’' In Pison. c. 23.

pros-imus li‹·to›·,] As the ‘lictors ' walked
in a line before the ‘ inagistratns,' the near-
est ‘lictor’ would be ‘pi-oxinuis,' as the
story in Livy (xxiv. 44) shows3 and this
appears to he the ‘lictor’ who was most
about the ‘magistratus' (Sallust, Jng. c.
12). 'she terni occurs on two inscriptions

Valerius Maximus (ii. 2, l), “nc quis se
