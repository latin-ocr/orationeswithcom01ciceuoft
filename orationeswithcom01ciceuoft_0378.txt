360 IN C. VERREM

adderetur. Jam id porro utrum libentes an inviti dabant?
Libentes? amabant, credo, Apronium. Inviti? qua re nisi vi et
malo cogebantur? Jam iste homo amentissimus in vendundis
decumis nummorum faciebat accessiones ad singulas decumas;
neque multum3 bina aut terna millia nummum addebat: fiunt per
triennium HS D millia fortasse. Hoc neque exemplo cujusquam
neque jure ullo fecit, neque eam pecuniam rettulit, neque hoc
parvum crimen quemadmodum defensurus sit homo quisquam
unquam excogitavit. ’

Quod quum ita sit, audes dicere te magno decumas vendidisse,
quum sit perspicuum te bona fortunasque aratorum non populi
Romani sed tui quaestus causa vendidisse? Ut si qui villicus ex
eo fundo qui sestertia dena meritasset, excisis arboribus ac ven-

ditis, demptis tegulis‚ instrumento, pecore abalienato, domino XX

neque multum ,-] These words seem to
refer to what he has just said; and ‘no
great amount,' ‘that was not much‚' ironi-
cally. For he goes on to say ‘bina aut
terna millia nummum addebat.'

HS D mill-iasortassej ‘ Fortasse’ is so

manager of an estate, who was sometimes
a slave, perhaps generally (Forcellini). The
use of ‘ villicus ¹ explains ‘ meritasset,' a
term which might refer to the ‘ merces' or
rent, but here it means, which had brought
in, or ‘ earned‚’ as we might say, ‘ sestertia

placed by Lg. 42. The common reading
is ‘fortasse HS,’ 810. Zumpt cannot ex-
plain how Cicero made out this sum.
‘ Fortasse' must be taken to signify ‘about.’
P. Manutius explains it thus. There were
seventy-two cities in Sicily, as Pliny says3
and if he took 2000 from each for three
years, that will make 432,000 3 and he took
from some not 2000, but 3000, which will
bring up the sum to a larger amount. But
this, as Zumpt observes, is manifestly a
false explanation, for many of the cities
were ‘vectigales,' not ‘decumanae 3' and
some were ‘immunes' Cicero says (c. 51)
‘ ager decumanus . . desertus est! The
‘decumanae‚' so far as appears from Ci-
cero's enumeration, were only thirty-four.
It seems to me that the words ‘ ad singu-
las decumas’ may refer to all the ‘decu-
mae ' which the ‘ civitates ’ paid, and not
to the several regular ‘decumae' of the
several ‘ civit-ates ;’ though, as Zumpt ob-
serveS, these ‘ alterae decumae ⁹ are treated
of afterwards.

audes dicere te] “Lag. 29, Paris. A. B„
audes te dic-ere, collocatione verborum ad-
modum eleganti ” (Zumpt); but he does
not adopt the order 3 Klotz does.

villicus] Written ‘vilicus' by Iordan.
The word clearly contains the same root as
‘ villa,' which may perhaps only be entitled
to one ‘ l.' A ‘ villicus' was an overseer or

dena? Zumpt observes that the reading of
Lg. 42 is not ‘HS denas but ‘sestertia
dena,’ which, as he observes, is very seldom
found in prose writers 3 and he only knows
one other example in Cicero (Paradox.
vi. 3), where ‘sexcena sestertia' is the true
reading, not ‘sexcenta sestertia?

instrumento,] This word occurs several
times in these orations. Among the Ro-
mans it had a fixed legal meaning, for ‘ in·
strumentum' was often the subject of a
legacy (Dig. 33. tit. 7, ‘De instructo vel
instrumento legato'). Ulpian (Dig. 33.
7, 8) says: “in instrumento fundi ea esse
quae fructus quaerendi, cogendi, conser-
vandi gratia parata sint, Sabinus libris ad
Vitellium evidenter enumerat 3²² and he
then proceeds to explain the definition.
The term, in its widest extent, might
comprehend all the stock of the farm,
slaves included. In some parts (quibus-
dam in regionibus) it had a wider meaning
than in others 3 and the interpretation of
the word was determined among the Ro-
mans by what we call the custom of the
country. It may be observed that κατα-
σκευή is used in the same, or nearly the
same sense, as the Roman ‘ instrumentum 3’
but whether it has a strictly technical
meaning, as ‘instrumentum' had in Latin,
Ι don't know.
