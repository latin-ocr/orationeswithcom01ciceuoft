EDICTA MAGISTRATUUM. 179

Imperium, a llsagistratus Minor could not do, because he had not the
necessary authority. Each Magistratus, whether he had Imperium or
not, had 1115 own functions‚ which he swore to exercise within the limits
of the law3 but within these limits there was room for the exercise of his
own judgment‚ which, in many cases, he was bound to follow, with such
advice and assistance as he could have from those who were competent to
give it. It did not often happen that one Magistratus was checked by
another in the exerc-ise of his functions, and least of all in the adminis-
tration of justice. The praetorship of Verres was an exception to the
ordinary practice. His illegal conduct was so scandalous and oppressive
that 1115 colleague had often to interpose his authority (In Verr. Lib. 1.
c. 46).

The function of a judge is to apply the law to ‘the facts of the case
which is brought before him3 to give to the general rules of law a living
reality by virtue of his particular application of them. The direct effect
of the judgment is to decide a particular case3 but the decision of a
particular case involves the declaration of a rule or rules of law3 and if
the judge has rightly understood the rule, and applied it right, his
decision 15 a record of what the law is or is supposed to be ε it is a pre-
cedent which may be followed 111 a like case. This is the ‘auctoritas
rerum judicata1·um‚’ as the Romans called it; and such precedents are
0110 of the means by which the law is made known and declared‚ par-
ticularly in doubtful cases3 and, the more precedents there are 111 like
cases, the greater is the certainty that the law is clearly understood and
established. But it was not in this way that the Roman Magistratus
exercised their infiuence on the development of law; for it was not
the ordinary process for the Magistratus to hear and decide a case. The
sunction of the Magistratus was to prepare the questions for the inves-
tigation and decision of a Judex: his was the ‘officium jus dicentis 3'
that of the Judex was the ‘ officium judicis? There were many cases iu
which the Praetor did decide or make decrees (decreta, or interdicta),
and principally in matters of possession, or quasi-possession. Hc then
acted (principaliter, Gaius, iv. 139, Sto), or in the first instance3 but his
authority 111 making decrecs is not that part of his functions which we
have to explain here.

In the earlier period of Roman law the power of the Magistratus was
limitcd by the forms of procedure. All plaints were made by Legis
Actiones, the form of which was fixed by the law, and a eomplainant
must make his demand according to the strict letter of it (Gaius, iv. 11),
or at least within the limits which the interpretation of the Jurisprn-
dentes had fixed. The Magistratus had, however, a certain discretionary
power. 110 could determine on what days, besides ‘ dies fasti‚’ he would
allow parties to apply to him3 for besides the ‘dies fasti,’ which were
