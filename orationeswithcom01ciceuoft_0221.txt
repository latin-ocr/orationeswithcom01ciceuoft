ACT. II. LIBER SECUNDUS. 203

illum annum pertulerant qui sic eos afflixerat ut salvi esse non
possent, nisi C. Marcellus quasi aliquo fato venisset, ut bis ex
eadem familia salus Siciliae constitueretur3 et post [ea] M. Antonii
infinitum illud imperium senserant. Sic a majoribus suis accepe-
rant, tanta populi Romani in Siculos esse beneficia ut etiam injurias
nostrorum hominum perferendas putarent. In neminem civitates
ante hunc testimonium publice dixerunt. Hunc denique ipsum
pertulissent, si humano modo, si usitato more, si denique uno
aliquo in genere peccasset. Sed quum perferre non possent luxu-
riem, crudelitatem, avaritiam, superbiam; quum omnia sua com·
moda, jura, beneficia senatus populique Romani unius scelere ac
libidine perdidissent3 hoc statuerunt, aut istius injurias per vos
ulcisci ac persequi, aut, si vobis indigni essent visi quibus opem
auxiliumque ferretis, urbes ao sedes suas relinquere, quandoquidem
agros jam ante istius injuriis exagitati reliquissent. IV. Hoc
consilio a L. Metello legationes universae petiverunt ut quam-
primum isti succederet: hoc animo toties apud patronos de suis
miseriis deplorarunt3 hoc commoti dolore postulata consulibus,
quae non postulata sed in istum crimina viderentur esse, ediderunt.

illum annum] The allusion, as Asco-
nius remarks, is to M. Aemilius Lepidus,

limited by the boundaries of any one pro-
vince. But there is nothing in this re·

who was praetor of Sicily B.C. 80, and
consul B.c. 78. He was the father of
the Lepidus who was one of the triumviri
with Octavianus Caesar and M. Antonius.
Lepidus was succeeded in his Sicilian prae-
torship by C. Marcellus, a great—grandson
of the conqueror of Syracuse (Lib. 3. c.
91). He was now one of the ‘judices ' on
the trial of Verres (Divin. e. 4). Cicero,
in these orations, often speaks of his ho-
nourable administration of the province
(Lib. 3. e. 16).

M. Antonii] This is M. Antonius Cre-
ticus, the son of the orator Antonius, aud
the father of M. Antonius, the colleagne of
Lepidus and Octavianus Caesar in the tri-
umvirate. (Sec ii. Lib. 1. c. 23, note.) In
B.c. 74 he received a eonnnission. with
very extensive power-S, to carry on the war
against the pirates aud he abused his
powerS. The critics have made a difficulty
about the words ‘infinitum illud impe-
1·ium,’f‹›r his ‘imperinm’ was limited, as
was that which Cn. Pompeius afterwards
received by the Manilia Lex, when he was
commissioned to clear the Mediterranean
of pirateS. But Cicero evidently means
that his powers were very great, and no
more. Ferraeei thinks that his ‘ imperium'
was called ‘ infinitum’ because it was not-

mark. His ‘ provincia’ was the war with
the pirates.

relinquera]
he has put a colon aster ‘ persequi.’—“ re-
linquerent codd. noti, etiam F. Defendit
Oudend. ad Ap. T. i. p. 72. Vulgata pri—
mum exstat ap. Mau. 15-10 '' (Iordan), who
has ‘ relinquere.’

4. L. Metello] L. Caecilius Metellus
succeeded Verres as praetor of Sicily 13.st
70, aud Cicero commends his administra-
tion. Yet he and his brothers, Q. Metel-
lus Creticus and M. Metellus attempted
to save Verres iu this prosecution (Aet. i.

Klotz has ‘relinquerent :'

c. 8, 9, 10).—‘ succedere' is to come into
the place of another, as one governor is
the ‘ successor’ ot' another. 'l‘he retiring
governor was said ‘ decedere,' or ‘decedere
de provincia' (Divin. 1); and he was
called ‘ decessor' (Tacit. Agric. 7).
postulata] ‘ Postulare' was a foronsio
term iu use in civil actions, but applied
also to demands of a public nature.
‘postulare’ is defined 11)· Ulpian (Dig.
3. 1. l): “1mstulare autem est desiderium
suum vel amici sui in jure apud eum qui
jurisdictioni praeest exponere, vel alterius
desiderio contradicere.” 'rho term was
also applied to the demands or elaims uf
