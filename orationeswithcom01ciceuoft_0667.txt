“NON MODO,'’ &o 647

nou aliqua simulatione existimationi se hominum venditasset? ” Here

q the ‘modo’ might be omitted also, for ‘qui . . putaret,' an ordinary

formula in Cicero, would express what is meant, but with somewhat less
precision than ‘ qui modo‚' which limits more exactly the ‘ guiltiest man ’
to one of the class who believed that there would be judieial investiga-
tion at Rome ³.

The notion contained in this word ‘modo,’ then, is that of ‘limit ;'
and ‘non modo ’ is a negation of the limit. In such an expression as
‘ tantum mod0,’ we have the meaning ‘so much, and no more 3’ or ‘that
is all) Now the only difficulty lies in seeing how the notion contained
in this ‘ non modo ' is to be combined with the notion contained in the
other words which it is intended to qualify. In the Divin. c. 4, ‘hi
sciunt hoc,’ gae„ the notion contained in ‘a me petitum' is not the
measure or limit: there was more than that. In Lib. 3. c. 31, ‘an
poterat non modo Apronius‚’ &c., Cicero's question of the possibility of
rejecting this corn is not limited to AproniuS, it extends to any body and
every body.

If I should be asked what is the best translation in all these in-
stances, I should answer that I do not know. I merely mean to say
that ‘not only,’ which happens to fit some cases, will not fit all cases3
and I would not quarrel with any translation of ‘non modo’ in any
given case, if it expressed the meaning with precision. There are
numerous expressions of common occurrence in modern languages,
which we find as difficult to express in our language as many of those
which occur in Roman writers, though we have the advantage of having
the precise force of such modern expressions explained by a living
teacher. Some of those words called adverbs and conjunctionS, which
are used very frequently, are perverted by usage in such a way that it is
hard to seize their precise meaning, and trace it up to the original signifi-
cation of the word.

There is another use of ‘ non modo,’ followed by ‘ne quideu1‚' which
requires a few words. In such cases as the following, ‘ non modo ' is
said to be used for ‘ non modo non‚’ an explanation which may lead to

misunderstanding :—

Act. i. c. 38.—“ Non modo proditori, sed ne perfugae quidem locus iu meis castris cui-

quam f11it.”
Lib. 3. ι’. 91.—“si ho(- crimen non modo Marcelli facto sed ne Lepidi quidem potes

defendere ;''—and Lib. ·l‹. e. 45, where there are two exemplos.

If we here translate ‘non modo ’ by ‘ not only,’ our idiom requires
that wc insert a negative which is not in the Latin, thus: ‘ not only no

³ Compare Livy, xxii. 2 : “ Primi qua modo praeirent duces? ἃς.
