44 REPETUNDAE.

critics say, in the Lex Calpurnia. The Lex Porcia however appears to
have done little towards checking or preventing exorbitant demands on
the subjects and allies of Rome.

There were however means of punishing magistrates who were guilty
of mal-administration. The Senate, as the chief administrative body in
the State, could itself examine into any case of mal-administration and
punish a cri1ninal; or the Senate could empower persons to examine into
complaints and do justice (Liv. xxxix. 33 xliii. 2). The Senate also could*
give authority to the Tribuni Plebis to prosecute a guilty person before
the Comitia Tributa (judicium Publicum) 3 as in the case of C. Lucretius
whom two of the Tribuni Plebis prosecuted (ad populum accusarunt:
Liv. xliii. 10). Livy adds: “comitiis habitis omnes quinque et triginta.
tribus eum condemnarunt.” In the case mentioned by Livy (xliii. 2)
the Senate empowered L. Canuleius, a Praetor, to appoint Recuperatores
from the Senate, who should determine, on hearing the evidence, what
amount was to be recovered from the accused. This was an instance in
which Recuperatores were employed in conformity, as it appears, with
their original functions of deciding in cases where Peregrini had a pecu-
niary demand against Romans, or Romans against Peregrini. (Div.
c. 17.) ’

All these modes of procedure being found insufficient, a permanent
court was formed for the trial of those Provincial magistrates who had
been guilty of illegal acts which came under the denomination of Repe·
tundae3 and thus originated the Quaestio Perpetua de Pecuniis Repe-
tundis. The Lex Calpurnia, which established this court, was proposed
and carried by the Tribunus Plebis, L. Calpurnius Piso Frugi, B.c. 149.
This Lex empowered Peregrini only to maintain an Actio of Repe-
tundae. Roman citizens in the like case could recover by the usual
form of proceedings (civili fere'actione, Cic. Div. c. 5). As to the form
of procedure, the court consisted of the Praetor Peregrinus as president,
and of a certain, but not an ascertained, number of Senators who sat as
J udices during a year, whence the name Quaestio Perpetua. These
J udices must not be confounded with Recuperatores‚ who were appointed
only for each particular case. Yet we read of Recuperatores being
sometimes employed in the case of Repetundae, as for instance under
the Lex Acilia. There was a Lex J unia de Repetundis, passed after the
Calpurnia3 but neither the time when it was enacted, nor the matter of
it is known. Some fix the date at ΒΟ. 126.
