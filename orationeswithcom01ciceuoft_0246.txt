228 IN G VERREM

quam in jus aditum esset, antequam montio denique controversiae
facta esset ulla, discessisset, putabant nihil agi posse. Homines
Rhegium proficiscuntur: Epicratem conveniunt: demonstrant id
quod ille sciebat se HS LXXX dedisse : rogant eum ut sibi id quod
ab ipsis abisset pecuniae curet3 ab sese caveat quemadmodum
velit de illa hereditate cum Epicrate neminem esse acturum. Epi-
crates homines multis verbis male acceptos ab se dimittit: redeunt
illi Rhegio Syracusas: queri cum multis, ut fit, incipiunt sese HS .
LXXX nummum frustra dedisse. Res percrebuit et in ore atque
sermone omnium coepit esse. Verres refert illam suam Syracusa-
nam: ait se velle de illis HS LXXX cognoscere. Advocat multos ε
dicunt Bidini Volcatio se dedisse: illud non addunt, jussu istius.
Volcatium vocat z pecuniam referri jubet. Volcatius animo aequis-
simo nummos affert qui nihil amitteret : reddit inspectantibus
multis: Bidini nummos auferunt. Dicet aliquis, Quid ergo in hoc
Verrem reprehendis, qui non modo ipse fur non est, sed ne alium
quidem passus est esse? Attendite: jam intelligetis hanc pecu-
niam, qua via modo visa est exire ab isto, eadem semita revertisse.

23. injus aditum] V has ‘ aditum pos-
tulatum in jus esset: where ‘postulatum ’
is a manifest interpolation.

curet ,·] The impudent demand was,
that Epicrates should pay, or see that they
were paid (curet), the amount which they
had given to Verres, and take such security
from them (ab sese caveat) as he should
think proper, that nobody should raise any
question about the ‘hereditas' This use

we should understand ‘fabulam.'

referri jubet] Zumpt, from Lg. 42 p.
m. Orelli and the previous editors have
‘ imperat,’ the reading of the other
MSS.

via] The contrast between ‘via' and
‘semita' is obvious enough. A ‘ via' was
the largest kind of road, a carriage-road, as
in the case of a ‘servitus,' and its width
was fixed by the Twelve Tables (Dig. 8. 3.

of ‘ curare ³ is common in Cicero : ‘me cui
jussisset curaturum ³ (Ad Fam. xxi. 9).
The MSS. have ‘ abesset,³ and Brunnius
thinks that the word inVis rather ‘abesset’
than ‘ abisset.³ Stil] ‘ abisset ’ is a proper
correctiou.—‘ velit de ³ διο. : Iordan has it
thus, ‘ velit: de illa' &c.

ubfit,] Klotz and Iordan from V and
Lg. 42 p. m. Zumpt has ‘ita ut fit?

*Syracusanam ,·] ‘ Verres resorts to his
old trick.’ There seems no occasion to
suppose with Hotmann, that there is any
error 111 the text. Manutius supplies ‘ ma-
litiam 3' and Gruter ‘cantilenam.' But the
word to be supplied is the universal ‘ reS,'
which means any thing. Zumpt refers to
a similar omission oi ‘res’ in Cicero, De
Nat. Deorum, i. 8, ‘ scd illa palmaris,’
where Davis unnecessarssy proposes to read
‘ sed illud palmare? Iordan has ‘ rem re-
fert 3' but there is a difl'erence between
mentally supplying the word and adding
it to Cicero’s text. Madvig supposes that

8). It is also the term for a public 01· high
road, as Via Appia. Among the various
examples cited of the contrast of ‘ via ³ and
‘ semita' is one from Ennius (Cic. De
Divin. i. 58) :

“ Qui sibi semitam non sapiunt alteri mon-
strant viam.'’

The old reading is ‘qua via . . eadem se-
mita‚' the objection to which, as Ziunpt
states it, is this: “intellegi nequit, quo-
modo, quae via sit, eadem e contrario se-
mita dici possit.” But, as the. money was
not really repaid by a ‘ via,5 so neither did
it return by a ‘semitm' It was repaid
openly : it was returned privately. It· the
word ‘ semita' were omitted, nobody could
doubt about the reading ς for it is plain that
the sentence does not require the relative
(qua) to refer to (ρος-1111133 but to the an-
tecedent which follows. “ J am intelligetis
hanc pecuniam . . revertisse:” “and how
did it return ? why, in the same direction
