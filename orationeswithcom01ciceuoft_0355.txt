[injuriis θῇ] These words are only in V.

persequuntur] V has ‘ persecuntur,' on
which Zumpt remarks ‘vere quidem.' I
suppose he means that Cicero wrote the
word so ,- or I do not understand in what
the ‘vere’ consists. Certainly ‘persecun-
tur ’ is as good as ‘persecutus ;’ but there
is nothing gained by adopting this ortho-
graphy in a single instance. It will be
some time before Roman orthography is
settled. The inscription of Venafrum (0.
30), of the time of Augustus, writes CV IVS
as the genitive of‘ qui· , 'and the Lex Tho-
ria, which may be considered as belonging
to Cicero's early age, writes QVOIVS. It
also writes PEQVNIAE, PERSEQVTIO, PE-
Qvnns, and also PEovnns. It also writes
QVOI (cui), QVOM (‘quum' or ‘cum') ; but
no c appears in it iu any form of the word
‘quo.' The Romam, as it appears, soon
came to write ‘ cuius ' for ‘ quoius‚' as we
see in the inscription of Venafrum, which
also has CVI (cui) and CVM (‘cum,' the con-
junction). This letter Q is only followed
by v. In this same Thoria Lex we find
PECORIS. This letter Q went out of use
in some forms, · but it w-is still retained in
a great 1111·111),115 we ma3¹ 5001111111) pagi 0

remarks on Q in his work entitled‘ ‘The

32. Herbitensis] The place 15 Herbita,
once a place of some note, und goverued
by ‘tyranni ’ (Diod. xii. 8). Its site is
supposed by some geographers to bc. near
the sources of the Symaethus 111111 N.W. of
Agyrium. Zumpt places it in 11 11110 110-
tween Centuripa 111111 Menae, 111111 about
half-way between these two places.

parcere et consulere,] V omits ‘et.'

modium xvii 1.] All these numbers are
uncertain. As an instance of the mode of
representing the numbers in V, where they
agree with this text, we may take ‘ tritici
modium {ff DCC,' which is 25700. In
this case V has 21. 00133 00133 1333 creec,
where M represents ‘ modium,’ and the
rest of the s3anbols respectively, 10000,
10000, 5000, 800, which is 100 more than
this text. In place of HS cm 013 V
has HS ΙΙ, and Lg. 42, 48 have ω ω,
which is the same thing, 2000.

praefecti nomine] Ι find no note on this
word ‘praefecti ' in any of the commenta-
ries which 1 have. Among the various
Officers in a province, Cicero 11115 already
enumerated‘ leg ati,' 1111111111 ‘tribuni’
The word‘ praet'cctus’ is so general' m its
signification, that it is impossible to 151 51ἕο
