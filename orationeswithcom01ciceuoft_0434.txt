416 IN O. VERREM

Romanus J udices comprobafint, ita M. Antonii exemplo istius
audaciam defendis.

XCII. At idem fecit Sacerdos—Hominem innocentem et summa
prudentia praeditum nominas3 sed tum idem fecisse erit existi-
mandus si eodem consilio fecerit. Nam genus aestimationis ipsum
a me nunquam est reprehensum3 sed ejus aequitas aratorum com-
modo et voluntate perpenditur. Non potest reprehendi ulla aesti-
matio quae aratori non modo incommoda non est sed etiam grata
est. Sacerdos, ut, in provinciam venit, frumentum in cellam
imperavit. Quum esset ante novum tritici modius denariis v, peti-
verunt ab eo civitates ut aestimaret. Remissior aliquanto ejus fuit
aestimatio quam annona 3 nam aestimavit denariis 111. Vides
eandem aestimationem propter temporis dissimilitudinem in illo
laudis causam habere, in te criminis, in illo beneficii, in te injuriae.
Eodem tempore praetor Antonius denariis ΠΙ aestimavit post
messem, summa in vilitate, quum aratores frumentum dare gratis
mallent. Et aiebat se tantidem aestimasse quanti Sacerdotem,
neque mentiebatur3 sed eadem aestimatione alter sublevarat ara-
tores, alter everterat. Quod nisi omnis frumenti ratio ex tempori-
bus esset et annona, non ex numero neque ex summa consideranda,
nunquam tam grati hi sesquimodii, Q. Hortensi, fuissent, quos tu

which, as Zumpt observes, we cannot ad-
mit. Zumpt, following Lg. 42, reads
‘senatus, populus, judices comprobat-int?

and he adds‚‘ ‘ut tres potestates in rep.
ἆσυνδέτως nominentur. '' But this expla-
nation is not satisfactory. Klotz settles
the difficulty by omitting ‘judices' as V
was supposed to do. But Brunnius thinks
that V has

SENATVS POPVLVS 1VD.CONPROBAR1NT.

If the text is right, ‘judices' must be
eithe1 the vocative or the nominative.
The vocative ‘judices’ would seem out of
place. Manutius observes that it is not
the vocative, but the nominativ:e “judices
enim appellat senatum populumque Roma-
num. ” This explanation seems to mc suffi-
cient: for ‘judices comprobarint’ perhaps
may be said in the same sense as ‘judicio
suo compr obarint.’

92. ante novum] That is, as Manutius
explains it, ‘frumentum.' Before the new
corn came in, the ‘ modius’ of wheat sold
for five ‘dcnarii,' or twenty ‘sesterces,'
which is a high price. There is nothing
improbable 111 whcat rising before the har-
vest, especially if the produce should be

uncertain: after the harvest (post mes-
sem) it was lower. This being the case,
the Sicilians asked Sacerdos to set an
‘aestimatio.' He might, we presume, have
demanded wheat at four ‘sestertii' the
‘modius ;' which would have been a loss of
sixteen to the farmer. Instead of this he
took money, fixing the value of a ‘modius '
nominally at three ‘denarii‚’ which amount
he seems to have received : for the ‘ aesti-
matio' was not the sum paid to the
farmer, but the sum that the ‘praetor' was
to receive. We will hope that he did not
take the money in respect of a larger
number of ‘modii’ than he was entitled
to. The X, which occurs sometimes both
in the MSS. and in the editions, is the
symbol of the ¹ denarius?
sesquimodii, ] Which he distributcd as
‘quaestor Manutius says. It alludes to a
gratuitous d1st11but10n of corn, as we may
collect. ‘Describeress says Hotmann, is
‘distribuere, dispertiri‚' and there is no
doubt that the word here must mean that.
But it ought to be‘ discrips' asses? ‘Dis-
cribere, distr'ibuere, go together in the
inscription of Venafrum (Lib. 2. 0. 30).
