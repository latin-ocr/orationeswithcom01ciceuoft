Aristaeus] The words ‘ ut Graeci
ferunt, Liberi filius ' cause a difficulty, for
Aristaeus was the son of Apollo, as Cicero
himself calls him (De Nat. Deorum, iii.
18). The words ‘Libero patre' mean
simply ‘father Liber ς’ and these words
almost decisively prove that the words
‘ Liberi filius ' are spurious. Virgil (Georg.
iv. 317) has told the story of Aristaeus and
his bees. Aristaeus has the credit of
having first made cheesc and oil, aud also
of having kept bees (Justin xiii. 7). His
useful inventions gave him a claim to be
in company with father Liber.

Flamininus] ‘ Fuerit' and ‘posuerat '
imply that the statue (lid not exist when
Cicero wrote this, and it doubtless perished
in the conflagration of the capitol, B.C. 84.
This statue of Jupiter Imperator however,
according to Livy (vi. 29), was brought
from Praeneste, B.C. 379, by the Dictator,
T. Quinctius Cincinnatus. Cicero, we
must suppose, is speaking of the same
statue; and he says that T. Quinctius
Flamininus, consul 13.c. 197, who defeated
king Philip at Cynoscephalae, in Thessaly,
brought it to Rome. Zumpt concludes
that one of the two is inistaken, which is
quite certain, if they ure speaking of the
same statue. He tixes the blunder on
Cicero, and suggests that the sameness of
the name T. Quinctius, may have deceived
him ; a most insufficient explanation, which
is not however his own, for it was sug-
gested by Graevius, or rather by Lipsius,
who thinks that the blunder arose from
the inscription on the statue being T.
Quinctii only, and some referring it to one
T. Quinctius, and some to the other. But
it could not in Cicero's time be a matter
of doubt, whether 1⁴'lamininus brought a
statue to Rome from Macedonia, a statue
which was a great work of art. Zumpt
objects, that it is certain that Flamininus
did not penetrate into any part of Mace-

Illud F la-

donia with his army, and accordingly it is
not clear where the statue came from. In
answer to this we have this passage. I
conclude that Flamininus certainly brought
from the Macedonian war a statue, which
in excellence might vie with that of Syra-
cuse. As to the Praenestine statue, we
cannot suppose that this was one of the
finest statues in the world, though it may
have been a Jupiter. It is clear enough
that there were two, one from Praeneste,
if Livy is right ς and another, certainly
from Macedonia, for Cicero, who does
make mistakes sometinms, would hardly
have published so notorious a blunder, if
the fact were that Flamininus did not
bring a Jupiter to Rome. Another thing
is clear, that the Romans gave Jupiter
the epithet Imperator, without respect to
the Greek name. Manutius and Graevius
saw this. Graevius says z “ Latinos autem
J ovem, quem Graeci dixerunt οὔριον, Impe-
ratorem appellasse, nulla habita ratione
Graecae vocis, constat non modo ex sequen-
tibus, uti Jovis Imperatoris signum, quod
in Capitolio fuit, ex Macedonia adportatum

in pontiore] This statue. belonged to
a temple on the Bosporus, on the Asiatie
side, at the point where the channel opens
to the Euxine (Mela, i. 19). llere was
the temple of Ζεὺς Οὔριος, and a statue of
the god. See Demosthen. adv. Leptin. ed.
Wolff, ξ 29, and his note. An inscription
belonging to this statue was discovered by
leeler and Spon, and printed iu Chisbull's
Antiqq. Asiatic„ p. (31, and frequently
since. The inscription is now in the
British Museum.
