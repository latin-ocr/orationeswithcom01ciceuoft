DIVINATIO. 27

reo mihi dicendum sit, non solum commoveor animo, sed etiam toto
corpore perhorresco. J am nunc mente et cogitatione prospicio
quae tum studia hominum, qui concursus futuri sint3 quantam
exspectationem magnitudo judicii sit allatura3 quantam auditorum
multitudinem infamia O. Verris concitatura3 quantam denique
audientiam orationi meae improbitas illius factura sit. Quae quum
cogito, jam nunc timeo quidnam pro offensione hominum, qui illi
inimici infensique sunt, et exspectatione omnium et magnitudine
rerum dignum eloqui possim. Tu horum nihil metuis, nihil cogi-
tas, nihil laboras? si quid ex vetere aliqua oratione, IOVEM EGO
OPTIMVM MAXIMVM, aut, VELLEM, sl FIERI POTVISSET, IVDICES, aut
aliquid ejusmodi ediscere potueris, praeclare te paratum in judicium

venturum arbitraris ⁴?

‘ Citare' is the word used
to signify a person being called upon to ap—
pear iu court by a ‘praeco,' after he has
been summoned in due form, as by the
praetor's ‘edictum,' for instance. Klotz
refers to Act. ii. Lib. 2. c. 38, 40.

non solum commoveor animo, sed etiam]
‘ Sed etiam’ stands in this position with
respect to ‘ solus ' not only when it is used
as an adverb, but also when it is used as an
adjective3 “nec mihi soli versat-ur ante
oculos—sed ctiam posteriS,'' ἃς. (De Ani.
c. 27.) ‘ Verum ' is also used after ‘ non
solum‚' as ‘ sed ' is. As ‘ solus ' means
‘ single,' ‘ whole‚' ‘entire,’ it is used with
‘ non ³ in those forms in which the writer
intends not only to affirm something, but
to add that this is not all,· that there is
Something more. ‘ Non solnm ’ is properly
enough rendered ‘not solely‚’ ‘singly‚’ or
‘ not only ε’ but it leads to great confusion
when ‘non niodo ³ is also translated ‘not
only,' though it is sometimes used like
‘ non solum ;' “ non modo praesentia. verum
etiam futura bella delevit '³ (De Am. c. 3).

Cicero's admission of the feeling that he
had when a case was called on, is evidence
of his sincere devotion to his profession of
an orator, and his consciousness of the duty
that he undertook. Such feeling-s are, with
very few exceptions, shared by all men of
real merit, especially at the connnenceinent
of their career as an advocate or public
speaker. Those -who begin any arduous
duties with perfect sels-confidenco and no
misgivings of themselves are not the men
who ultimately obtain tlw highest and best
desei-ved distinction. Klotz refers to the
following passages in which Cicero speaks
of himself to the same ell'ect as in this
passage: De Orat. i. 265 l'ro Cluentio, c.

eitato reo]

Ac si tibi nemo responsurus esset, tamen

Roscio Amerino, e. 4.

fat-{ura sih] Orelli, Zumpt, (ἔα, have
simply ‘facturas Klotz observes, “fac-
tura, errore opinor typographi inde a D.
Lambino propagato.” Iordan says ‘sib
om. dtt.'

Quae quum cogito, jam ‘nunc' linteo]
This is a good example of ‘quum' being
used with the indicative, when the object
is to denote an event contemporancous
with another circumstance, which is also
express-ed by the present tense.

‘ Quiihiam ³ is one of the forms of ‘ qui ³
to which ‘ nam ³ is added, and it appears to
give emphasis to the expression, whether it
is used interrogativer or not, as in this
instance. The words ‘ ubinam: ⁴ utinam?
are other examples of the addition of
‘nam‘ to the forms of ‘quis for sucli
‘ nbi ' and ⁸ uti ' are. 'l'he meaning ot* this
passage ist ⁸ as soon as l think os all this,
l begin to sear that l shall hardly be able
to utter any thing comnmnsurate with
(pro),’ ἂν.

αι· velere aliqua, Se] Cicero supposes
his adversary so barren in invention as to
be compelled to resort to some trite form
of comment-ing liis address, which might
be well enough as it was originally used,
bnt is ridiculous when it is a mere imita-
tion. Servius (ad Aen. xi. 301) says that
the people of old always began their
orations with an invocation oi' the gods.
and he adds, “sicut sunt omnes ‹uuiti-mes
Catonis ct. ‹hau-elim nam gencrale caput
in omnibus leg-imus. l'mle Cicero pei·
irrisionem ait: si quis cx vetere ““ (ed.
Masv.) ἂν.
