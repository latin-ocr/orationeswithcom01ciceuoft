administration with respect to the corn (frumentum) of Sicily (Lib. 3);
his plunder of works of art (Lib. 4); and his cruelty (Lib. 5).

Verres was succeeded in his government of Sicily by L. Caecilius .
Metellus (Bc. 70). He carried most of his plunder to Rome in a vessel
which the people of Messana built for him3 for this city had received
some favours from Verres, and had been a depot for part of his ill-gotten
property. The Sicilians, having determined to prosecute their late
praetor for his mal-administration, chose Cicero to conduct the prose-
cution. Cicero bad been quaestor Rc. 75, under the praetor Sex. Pe-
ducaeus, in the Lilybaean or western district of the island, and he had
gained the good-will of the people by his upright conduct. On taking
leave of the Sicilians in Rc. 74, he promised them his assistance, if ever
they should want it, and all the cities of the island now called upon him
to redeem his promise, Syracuse and Messana excepted. This was a
great opportunity for Cicero, and he eagerly seized it, as the whole tenor
of these speeches shows, notwithstanding certain rhetorical flourishes
about his unwillingness to change his practice of defending the accused,
in order to become a public prosecutor. Verres had the support of Q.
and M. Metelli, the brethren of L. Metellus, now the propraetor of Sicily.
The great orator Q. Hortensius was to defend Verres, who had many
friends among the optimates or senatorian party, and contrived also to
gain the support of L. Metellus, who, as governor of Sicily, did what he
could for him. The senators generally disliked such a prosecution as
that with which Verres was threatened: many of them had enriched
themselves at the expense of the provinces3 and others, who had not,
hoped to have the opportunity. The reforms of the Dictator Sulla had
deprived the equites of the power of sitting as judices, and made the
senators only eligible3 but the senators had often abused their power,
and acquitted great criminals of their own body. At the time when the
prosecution of Verres was preparing, there was &loudnutery against
the-judicia] body, and a demand sor its reformation. Cicero saw, and
hex! told the judices who sat on the trial of Verres, that the result would
be the condemnation or absolution of their own body. If they con-
victed V erres, it was a triumph for Cicero to have brought to punishment
the plunderer of Sicily, to have vindicated the purity of the J adici-1 aud
to have humbled the arrogance of Hortensius, the tyrant of the coni-ts.
If Verres was acquitted, it would not be for want of industry or ability
in the patron of the Sicilians, but through the corruption of the senatorial
body, out of whom the judiees were chosen. In either way Cicero could
not fail to gain the favour of the equites, the class to which he belonged,
and the class from which, from the time of the Gracchi to the legislation
of Sulla, the judices had been chosen. The mass of the people too would
be on his side, if for no other reasons, from hatred to those who possessed
