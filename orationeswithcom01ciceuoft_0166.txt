148 IN C. VERREM

multa esse in provinciis aliter edicenda ; non de hereditatum quidem
possessionibus, non de mulierum hereditatibus. Nam [in] utroque
genere video non modo ceteros sed te ipsum totidem verbis edixisse
quot verbis edici Romae solet. Quae Romae magna cum infamia
pretio accepto edixeras, ea sola te, ne gratis in provincia male audires,
ex edicto Siciliensi sustulisse video. Et quum edictum totum eorum
arbitratu, quamdiu fuit designatus, componeret, qui ab isto jus ad
utilitatem suam nundinarentur, tum vero in magistratu contra illud
ipsum edictum suum sine ulla religione decernebat. Itaque L. Piso
multos codices implevit earum rerum in quibus ita intercessit quod
iste aliter atque ut edixerat decrevisset. Quod vos oblitos esse non
arbitror, quae multitudo, qui ordo ad Pisonis sellam isto praetore
solitus sit convenire3 quem iste collegam nisi habuisset, lapidibus
coopertus esset in foro. Sed eo leviores istius injuriae videbantur
quod erat in aequitate prudentiaque Pisonis paratissimum perfugium,
quo sine labore, sine molestia, sine impensa, etiam sine patrono ho-
mines uterentur. Nam, quaeso, redite in memoriam, judices, quae
libido istius in jure dicundo fuerit, quae varietas decretorum, quae
nundinatio, quam inanes domus eorum omnium qui de jure civili con-

mcndinarentur,] ‘Nundinae,³ every ninth
day, was a kind of market—day. ‘ Nundinari'
is to buy and sel] ,· hence here it signifies to
traffic m'th Verres, who had ¹ jurisdictio ³ as
‘ praetor u1·banus.'-—‘ illud ipsum edictum τ’
‘ipsum ' om. Orelli. Zumpt has taken ‘ip-
sum ’ from Lg. 29.

decernebat] ‘ Decernere,' ‘ decretum,’
are the terms applicable to decisions in
particular caseS. The praetor's decision,
of course, ought to be conformable to his
‘ edictum: or ‘ general rules,’ and to dex-iate
from this was an offence against ‘relig-io?
Instances of praetors not acting conform-
ably to their ‘ edictum ’ were not rare, and
a Lex Cornelia was passed B.C. 67, which
required the praetors to administer jus-
tice conformably to their Edicta Perpetua
(Ascon. in Cic. Cornel. p. 585 Dion Cas-
sius, xxxvi. 23). See Exciusus iv.

L. Piso] Piso was a colleague of Verres,
and probably Praetor Peregrinus. A ‘ma-
gistratus ³ of equal or superior rank might
be appealed to from the decree of a ‘ma-
gistratuS‚’ with whose ‘decretum ’ a de-
fendant was dissatisfied. The appeal was
called ‘ appellatio,' and the interposition of
the ‘ magistratus’ who was appealed to
was called ‘intercessio.' The effect of the
‘intercessio ' was negative. It stopped any
thing from being done by virtue of the
decree or order which was appealed against,

and consequently it was for the protection
of the defendant, and not of the plaintiff.
The ‘tribuni plebis’ had also a power of
‘ intercessio ' against the orders even of the
praetors and consuls (Pro Quintio, c. 7. 20,
21, vol. ii. ς Savigny, System, &c., Appel-
latio and Provocatio, xi. Beilage nn).

We learn from this passage, that the
‘magistratus' kept a record, or notes, of
their proceedingS, which would serve to
refresh their memory, and as a guide in fu-
ture cases. They were sometimes called
‘ commentarii, actorum commentam‘a?

Quod ros . . . quae] There is no difficulty
about this form of expression. Comp. De
Am. c. 15, “ Quod Tarquinium dixisse fe-
runt . . se intellexisse quos fidos amicos ha-
beret,” &a 3 and “Quod nisi Metellus hoc
tam graviter egisset,'’ Lib. 2. 0:66. Also
Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 26, ‘ quod ubi ille intel-
lexit id agis &cz Lib. 1. c. 39, ‘quod 'tu—-
aliud ;' Terence, Phorm. ii. 1. 5, “Quod
utinam ne Phormioni id suadere in mentem
incidisset ;'' and Andr. i. 5. 54, ‘Quod te
ego,' &cu See also Pro Cluent. c. 9, ‘Ita
quod,’ ἃς. vol. ii.

redite in memoriam] Forcellini cites
Cicero De Senectute, c. 7, ‘in memoriam
redeo ;’ and Pro Quintio, c. 183 and he
says that it means, as in this case, ‘ see that
you remember.'
