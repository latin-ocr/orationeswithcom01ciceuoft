cumae' on the account of the ‘civitas’
(publice) on the terms which Apronius had
given for them, which were too high.
Thus they would, in fact, pay more than
the ‘deeumaes and, besides this, they
were to give something to Apronius, who
would thus be rid of his bargain, and get
a sum of money simply for nothing. The
money however was really for Verres, as
Cicero says. Apronius was his man of all
work. See c. 32. 37.

capere et conciliare] Lg. 42 omits the
‘et' between these words, and Zumpt,
Klotz, and Iordan follow it. If Cicero
were closely adhcring to the technical
form of the Roman Leges, he would omit
the ‘ et ;' and he may have done so here,
asin c. 94, ‘de pecunia capta conciliata,'
where Zumpt notices no variation in the
reading. But in that instance the form
of expression is such that the ‘ et' might
well be omitted, even if Cicero were not
following the technical ternis of a ‘ lex.'
In c. 40 Zumpt reads ‘ pecuniae captae et
eoneiliatae.’ As to the Roman legal form
of expression, it is well known that the
usual formula is to heap words upon one.

and the conjunctim] ‘ et' is mnitted. Ex·

suffice :

lucri tritici] ‘ Lucri ' is a correction of
Hotmann’s, confirmed by Lg. 42. The
reading of the other MSS. is ‘luerum,‘
which Orelli has.

Quid hoc est ?] Lg. 42. Iordan has
‘ Quid est hoc ?’

ex uno agro] ‘Ager' is a name for a
territorial division, as ‘Ager Sal›inu.<,'
¹ Ager Romanus ς’ or amnne by which a
whole tract of some definite limits is sig-
nitied. ‘Plebis Romanae' is so placed
that we may doubt whether it is to be
connected with ‘agro’ or with ‘prope
menstrua cibarias but Ι think that Cicero
means ‘plebis . . cibaria? 'l’he ⁸ decumae '
were for the supply of Rome, and this was
almost as nmch as would furnish the ‘plebs'
of Rome for a month. This practice of
distributing wheat among the poor citizens
of Remeat a low rate, ᾖ as the modius,
was established by the Lex Fruuwnlariu
ot* C. Gracchus. Compare c. 36, ⁶ de populi
Romani victu‚' ἆυ.

Hs uc] So it stands in Zumpt ; and at
the end of this chapter he writes ‘ Hs:
(z sestertii i.e. singuli sest.) instead os
‘Hs 111.' By a comparison of the nnm-
bers in this and the following chapter,
it appears that there is an error in some
of tho numerals, for the sum total of
the money that was got for approving of
the corn which was given as a present, is
made ἰῖε. lf the numey mentioned as ex—
tortcd in e.. 30 is made HS xxxin, which
is the same number of sesterces as of me-
