80 IN O. VERREM

horum famae comparantur; si soceri Scauri constantiam ut'ne quis
te de vera et certa possit sententia demovere3 intelliget populus
Romanus integerrimo atque honestissimo praetore delectoque con-
silio nocenti reo magnitudinem pecuniae plus habuisse momenti ad
suspicionem criminis quam ad rationem salutis.

XVIII. Mihi certum est non committere ut in hac causa praetor
nobis consiliumque mutetur. Non patiar rem in id tempus adduci,
ut Siculi, quos adhuc servi designatorum consulum non moverunt, *
quum eos novo exemplo universos arcesserent, 005 tum lictores con-
sulum vocent3 ut homines miseri, antea socii atque amici populi
Romani, nunc servi ac supplices, non modo jus suum fortunasque
omnes eorum imperio amittant, verum etiam deplorandi juris sui
potestatem non habeant. Non sinam profecto causa a me perorata,
quadraginta diebus interpositis, tum nobis denique responderi quum
accusatio nostra in oblivionem diuturnitatis adducta sit: non com·
mittam ut tum haec res judicetur quum haec frequentia totius Ita-
liae Roma discesserit, quae convenit uno tempore undique, comitio-

cero might have repeated ‘ consulum? If
he did not, he must use ‘eorum.' Klotz
remarks that Ernesti would refer ‘ eorum ³
to ‘lictores,' which seems hardly credible.

wife to Cn. Pompeius Magnus, as Plutarch
tells 115 111 the life of Sulla, c. 33. Klotz
observes that Scaurus is still called the
father-in-law of Glabrio, because Glabrio's

son by Aemilia was still living, and conse-
quently the affinity according to Roman
notions still subsisted. He observes, in a
note on thc Pro P. Quintio, c. 6, that the
Romans considered affinity only to exist so
long as either the woman whom a man had
married was alive, or at least the children
of the marriage3 and he refers to the Pro
Sestio, c. 3. See the note on Pro P.
Quintio, 0. 6, vol. ii.

dmm-erm] ‘dimovere' Gl Ld Lg 42.
—‘ momenti :' ‘more force or eflbct,' an
example of the original sense of the word.

18. ut Sicula] Madvig proposes to omit
‘ Siculi‚' though all the MSS. have it; and
Iordan has omitted it.' The correction is
specious, but like some other corrections of
the same excellent critic, it is not true.
We might suppose that some copyist in-
serted the word, 01· wrote 'it in the margin
by way of explanation. But if we look
carefully at the passage, we may see that
Cicero would hardly omit to name the Sici-
113115, aud that the mention of their name
adds force to the passage. He says ‘ut
Siculi *η’ and then he interposes ‘quos
adhuc . . . vocent? He resumes with ‘ ut
homines iniseri,' which corresponds to ‘ut
Siculi?

eorum] That is, the ‘consules' Orelli
remarks ‘ sine causa suspectum Ern.’ Ci-

The ambiguity of ‘ eorum,' if there is any,
is shared by all languages.

quadraginta diebus] “ Iis qui sunt per
binos ludos, votivos atque Romanos, quos
3111 bini consecuturi erant, Victoriae atque
plebeii '³ (Ascon.). See Introd.

responderi] Klotz has ‘ respondere,’
which he says 15 the reading of the best
MSS. But according to Iordan ‘respon-
dere ³ is not the reading of any MS. Orelli
has ‘ respondeant.³ Klotz rightly under-
stood the words in a general sense, and he
applies them generally to the answer or de-
fence, and not to any particular person : but
for that ‘ responderi ⁹ is the true word. It
corresponds in its generalizing form to ‘ causa
perorata? Zumpt and Iordan say that ‘ re-
sponderi ' is a correction of Lambinus.

comitiorum 49⁶2] Asconius, as usual,
has a kind of paraplnase, which contains
little more than the original 3 but he adds
that the censors were Gellius and Lentulus.
A census was held 111 this year, B.C. 70, by
the censors L. Gellius Poplicola and Cn.
Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus. As to the
censorship see Divin. c. 3. Τ110 preceding·
censorship was in Ire. 86. After the enact-
ment of the ‘ Lex J ulia ⁵ (B.c. 90), by which
the ‘ Ciw‘tas ³ was given to the ‘ Socii ⁷ and
