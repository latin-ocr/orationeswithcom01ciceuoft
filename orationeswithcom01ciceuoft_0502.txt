484 IN C. VERREM

grandibus literis P. Africani nomen erat incisum, eumque Kartha-
gine capta restituisse perscriptum. Colebatur a civibus t ab omni-
bus advenis visebatur: quum quaestor essem, nihil mihi ab illis est
demonstratum prius. Erat admodum amplum et excelsum signum
cum stola3 verumtamen inerat in illa magnitudine aetas atque
habitus virginalis. Sagittae pendebant ab humero 3 sinistra manu
retinebat arcum3 dextra ardentem facem praeferebat. ‚Hanc quum
iste sacrorum omnium et religionum hostis praedoque vidisset,
quasi illa ipsa face percussus esset, ita flagrare cupiditate atque
amentia coepit. Imperat magistratibus ut eam demoliantur et
sibi dent: nihil sibi gratius ostendit futurum. Illi vero dicere
sibi id nefas esse ; seque quum summa religione tum summo metu
legum et judiciorum teneri. Iste tum petere ab eis, tum minari,
tum spem, tum metum ostendere. Opponebant illi nomen interdum
P. Africani: populi Romani illud esse dicebant: nihil se in eo
potestatis habere quod imperator clarissimus urbe hostium capta
monumentum victoriae populi Romani esse voluisset. Quum iste
nihilo remissius atque etiam multo vehementius instaret quotidie,
res agitur in senatu. Vehementer ab omnibus reclamatur. Itaque
illo tempore ac primo istius adventu pernegatur. Postea quidquid
erat oneris in nautis remigibusque exigendis, in frumento impe-
rando, Segestanis praeter ceteros imponebat aliquanto amplius
quam ferre possent. Praeterea magistratus eorum evocabat: opti-

tion of the statue is another instance of

the work of Praxiteles. She held a torch
in her right hand, she had a quiver on her

Cicero's own lang-uage belying his asser-
tions. He had a taste for art, as we have
already seen (c. 3, note) 3 and he takes
some pains to show that he was not one of
those whom Verres called ‘ idiotae.'

He describes this Diana (Ἄρτεμις) as a
colossal figure, with the characteristics of a
young unmarried female, with long drapery
reaching to the feet, as in the statues of the
old style, and not with the short frock, as
she was afterwards represented. The quiver
and the arrows were suspended from her
shoulder ; and in her left hand shehelda bow,
and in the right hand a blazing torch. So
SophocleS, Oed. Tyr. 201, represents her:

τάς τε πυρφόρους
Ἀρτέμιδος αἵγλας ξὺν αἷς
Aba? ὄρεα διᾴσσει.

Sometimes she was represented with a torch
in each hand, and the bow and quiver hung
over her shoulders. , Pausanias (x. 37, 1)
describes an Artemis at Anticyra in Phocis,

shoulders, and a dog was standing by her
on the left. The size of the figure was
above that of the largest woman. There
is in the Louvre a figure of Diane a la
Biche, as it is called, because a fawn is
running by her on the left side. She holds
the bow in her left hand downwards3 with
the right she is taking an arrow from the
quiver on her shoulder. Her legs are
bare, and she has richly ornamented san-
dals. The representations of the goddess
were numerous, and varied according to
the different characters in which she was
supposed to act.· See Miiller‚ Handbuch

nautis remigibusque] From this and
other passages we collect that the provin-
cials were liable to requisitions of meu for
the navy, as well as bound to supply ships
in some cases (Lib. 1. c·. 34). Segesta was
