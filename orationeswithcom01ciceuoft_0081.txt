ACTIO PRIMA. 63

spem nunc habeat in manibus et quid moliatur breviter jam, judices,
‚ vobis exponam. Sed prius ut ab initio res ab eo constituta sit,
quaeso, cognoscite. Ut primum e provincia rediit, redemptio est
hujus judicii facta grandi pecunia. Ea mansit in conditione atque
pacto usque ad eum finem dum judices rejecti sunt. Posteaquam
rejectio judicum facta est, quod et in sortitione istius spem fortuna
populi Romani et in rejiciendis judicibus mea diligentia istorum
impudentiam vicerat, renuntiata est tota conductio. Praeclare se
res habebat. Libelli nominum vestrorum consiliique hujus in
manibus terant omnium. Nulla nota, nullus color, nullae sordes
videbantur his sententiis allini posse3 quum iste repente ex alacri
atque laeto sic erat humilis atque demissus ut non modo populo

Ut primum . . . reddin] ‘ Ut,’ with ‘ pri-
mum’ aud without, and ‘ubi' also, are
used with the indicative perfect, to indicate
‘as soon as? Act. ii. Lib. 1. 8. 6, ‘ Romam
ut ex Sicilia redii?

redemptio] ‘ Redimere, ' like ’ 8011(111-

do something for a sum of money. ‘Con-

the use of a thing, or to be received for the
doing of something (Gaius, iii. lm, &eq
Dig. 19. tit. 2). ‘Some one,’ says Cicero,

‘made an agreement 111111 Verres, by 11 111(11

form of a pact, or bare agreement, until
the J udices were challenged? A ‘ conditio ’

something else is made to depeud. Here
the ‘ conditio ¹ was the. constitution of the
Consilinum for, if ,511811 11 body of 1111111885

the most general Roman term for any agree-

All the MSS. have‘ ea mansit in ditione‚'
or ‘ (lictioue‚' which 15 3 manifest blunder ;
and ‘ conditione ’ is the true reading, which
Asconius and S have preserved. After the
Consilium was determiued b3v the Sortitio

Iordan has ‘renuntiata est tota condicio,'
and he says, “ condicio Asconii edd. vett. et
MS. Leid. Agroetius p. 2271. Ρ : dicio
Gl ; conclusio (12 Ld ; (·ontluch'o, vulgo ‹).'’
The MSS. authority then ean hardl3v decide
the question, though we learn from Halm
that all the ng. have ‘comluctio.’ The
‘ conditio’ had failed, aud there is no sense.
in saying ‘renuntiata cst tota conditio) lt
was the bargain about which the notice
was given.
