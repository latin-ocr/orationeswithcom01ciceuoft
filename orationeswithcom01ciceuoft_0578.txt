IN O. VERREM

At enim idcirco navem Mamertinis non impe-

fetialium manibus educatum, unum praeter ceteros in publicis

you have contracted for building? ‘Emere'
(to purchase) is 0110 way of getting a. thing.
‘ Locare' (to agree to give so much for a
piece of work to be done) is the only other
usual way of getting a thing. There re-
main two other wayS, by gift, and by
fraud or theft. Verres must have either
bought the ship(e1nerc),*or he must have
furnished materials and engaged (locare)
some person to build it for him ; or he
must have got it in some irregular way.

Dii approbent :] Said sarcastically.
‘ We have a man brought up among the
fetiales :' so expert is he in the J us
Fetiale. Varro, De L. L. iv. 15 z “ Fetiales
fidei publicae inter populos praeerant. Per
hos enim fiebat ut justum conciperetur
bellum et ut foedere fides constitueretur.''
The J 115 Fetiale was that branch of law,
improperly so called, which had reference
to treaties, the declaring of war and peace,
the condition of ambassadors, and so forth3
the original of that kind of law which we
call the Law of N ations, or International
Law.

The Romans had a short way and a good
way of dealing with a Roman who violated
the Jus Fetiale, or 111 fact dealt with an
enemy in any way that they did not like.
They gave him up (dederunt) to the enemy,
and so eased themselves of him. Here we
learn that some places, by the terms of
their ‘ foedus‚' were relieved from the con-
tribution of ships, or ship-money. The
following passage of Varro is quoted by
Nonius: “ si cujus legati violati essent,
qui id fecissent, quamvis nobiles essent,
uti dederentur civitati statuerunt, fetiales-
que viginti qui de his rebus cognoscerent,
judicarent, statuerent, constituerunt.”

These foreign dependencies of Rome
were not solely protected at the expense of
Rome. They were required to supply means
for their own protection, and they also fur-
nished contributions to the ruling state.
So different 15 the modern system, and par-

defending foreign possessions which make no
direct contribution to the ruling state. The
management of the extensive Indian domi-
nions is an exception,v and is conducted
after the Roman fashion. The subjects
pay every thing, and get little in return.
For instance, from 1830 to 1834, the gross
revenue from salt alone, in the three pre-
sidencies of India, averaged 2‚184,415l.
annually. This salt 15 manufactured -by
the Indian government, and the govern-
ment is the only salt-maker. Salt is also
imported, and the duty brings in a large
sum. For the year ending April 30th,
1861, the gross receipts 011 Salt are esti-
mated at 3‚391‚630l., exclusive of Customs'
duty on salt imported. The anticipated
receipts on salt for 1861-,2 are 3‚980‚000l.,
and on the Customs' duty for salt
1‚255‚000l. An increase of near 600,000l.
in the Salt Revenue is expected to arise
from a small increase in the duty. In a rich
country like England an increased revenue
is got by a reduc-tion of duties on articles
of common use; for the consumption in-
creases in a greater ratio than the duty
is reduced ; more is consumed, and conse-
quently more persons get what they want,
or the same number get more of what they
want. In a poor country like India, more
money may be raised by a tax, though no
more of the taxed article may be con-
sumed3 but then the people pay the in-
creased tax out of their earnings, and have
so much less left for other necessary pur-
poses. Those who are curicus to see how
and how much money is raised by the
Indian government and how it is spent,
may turn to East India Finance and Re-
venue Accounts 15th May, 1861. There
is no oppression in India such as Verres
practised, but Ι doubt if the Romans would
nave got as much out of India as the
Indian government (1005. If we look to the
expenditure of this large revenue of about

amount, are taxed (1851-61), 111 order to

likely that India may some day be a eost
to Great Britain, while many of our people
are living 011 the produce of Indian taxa—
tion. But when that time shall come, if it
ever shall come, the empire of British India
will end, or India must be ruled at less
eost.
