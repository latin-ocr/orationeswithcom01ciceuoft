ORATIONS AGAINST C. VERRES.

IN the year B.c. 29, in the consulship of Cn. Pompeius Magnus and
M. Licinius Crassus, M. Tullius Cicero was a. candidate for the curule
aedsseship, and in the same year the Sieilians selected him for their
patronus in the prosecution of C. Verres for mal-administration during
his three years’ government of Sicily. C. Verres was the son of C.
Verres, a Roman senator, who was still living at the time when his son
was governor of Sicily. The gentile name of C. Verres is never men-
tioned, and he probably had no other name than Verres. It is merely a
conjecture, supported by no evidence, that his gentile name was Corne-
lius. His assumed relationship to the Caecilii Metelli is rather dis-
proved by the passages usually cited to prove it. (Act. ii. Lib. 2. c. 26,
56.) Verres had a wife, Vettia, who bore him a daughter and a son.
The son, though he had not attained the age to assume the ‘toga virilis,'
accompanied his father to Sicily, and was a witness of his scandalous

conduct. (Lib. 3. c. 9, 68, 71.)

In the Verrine Orations Cicero represents Verres as an ignorant,
brutal, and licentious man. He even gives him no credit for taste,
though he had a passion for works of art3 but- here the orator has
perhaps gone too far, for that Verres had some taste is proved by Cicero
himself. Of the earlier part of his life Cicero says little: he professes
to pass over the sins of his youth as things notorious.

Cicero says that Verres was the quaestor of the consul Cn. Papirius
Carbo, in Cisalpine Gaul, fourteen years before the trial (13.0. 70), and
he declares that all the acts of Verres from his quaestorship should
furnish matter for the accusation. (Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 12.) Accordingly
the orator distributas his charges under four lieads:tlie-Q1aestorsl1ip of:
Verres; his legatio ¹314&ssss thtura urbana3 and his go-veriiinent of
Sicily. If Verres was quaestor to Carbo m 13.c. 84³, Has* was in the
second consulship of Carbo; but Cicero appears to have made-1 mis-tal- o

as to the fourteen years. For, as Drumann observes, it was in B.c. 82
r.
