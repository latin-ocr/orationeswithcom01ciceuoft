6 IN TRODUOTION .

tensius consul designatus was Verres’ advocate. (Brutus, c. 92; Act.
i. c. 13.)

The trial began on the 5th of Sextilis (August), according to the
unreformed Calendar. The games os Cn. Pompeius in celcbration of
the successful termination of the war against Sertorius were to begin on
the 15th of August and to last fifteen days; and these games would be
followed by the Romani Ludi, which began on the 4th of September,
and lasted fourteen days, with an interval of two days between the two
sets of Romani Ludi. The opponents of Cicero expected that they
should not have to begin the defence until these games were over.
They would easily occupy with talking and legal quibbles all the time
between the Romani Ludi and the Ludi of Victoria, which began on the
27th of October and lasted five days. The Plebeii Ludi in November
would next follow, very little time would be left for business during
the current year, and finally the trial, as they expected, would be post-
poned to the next, when M. Metellus would be praetor. (Act. i. c. 10.)
But instead of delivering an elaborate speech, which he had prepared,
Cicero opened his case briefly in the first Verrine oration (Actio Prima),
and then stated the chief charges against Verres, confirming each state-
ment as he went on by an examination of witnesses, and the production
of documentary evidence. Hortensius occasionally interrupted the wit-
nesses to make some objections, but the evidence was too strong for him,
and he saw that a defence was impossible. He did not &oss-examine
any of Cicero's witnesses. (Act. ii. Lib. 5. c. 59.) Cicero only took
nine days for the prosecution3 and before the nine days were over,
Verres left Rome for Marseille, and the judices condemned him to exile,
and to make full compensation in damages. The assessment of the
damages (litis aestimatio) came afterwards, as was usual in such cases.
It seems that the Sicilians did not obtain full satisfaction3 and we may
assume that Verres thought it better to leave Rome with what he could
take with him, than to wait for the result of the assessment and perhaps
lose all that he had, and also run the risk of other prosecutions.

The oration entitled ‘Divinatio,’ and the ‘Actio Prima,’ were the
only Verrine Orations which were spoken. Cicero wrote the other five
after the trial. He has handled his matter so skilfully that, if we were
unacquainted with this fact, we should never suspect that we were
reading a rhetorical exercise3 for such the five last Verrine Orations
are, though the orator doubtless wished to leave to posterity not only a
sample of his art, but a merciless exposure of the plunderer of Sicily, of
his eloquent advocate, and of the senatorian body who had attempted to
save him. Cicero however has transgressed the limits of his subject in the
first of the five orations, which is chiefly on Verres' praetorship at Rome,
