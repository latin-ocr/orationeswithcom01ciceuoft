SICILY A ROMAN PROVINCE. 643

fears and of the gross adulation of the Greeks. Under the emperors it
was carried still further. When Cicero was governor of ‘Cilicia, he had
the decency to forbid it. (Ad Attic. v. 21.)

WVhen Verres lauded in Sicily the island was probably in a more
prosperous state than it ever was before, or ever has been since, unless
perchance in the time of Augustus, or under the mild and prudent
administration of the Antonines. Since the overthrow of the Carthagi-
nian power and the suppression of the servile revolts, it had enjoyed
many years of tranquillity, being united under one government, which
allowed no tyrant but itself. Under the system of farming‚ which

employed large capitals‚ the produce was greatly increased. It had an
⁴ extensive commerce and various manufactureS. Malta, a dependency of
Sicily, was famed for its fine linen. The industrious Greeks of Sicily
produced excellent household furniture, and numerous articles of domes-
tic use of exquisite taste. Couches, candelabra, carpets, plate of excel-
lent workmanship, carved work in ivory, bronzes, pictures, and statues
were the evidence of the wealth, the taste, and the artistic skill of the
population of the island.

Dureau de la Malle (Economie Politique des Romaius), whose work I
have already cited, has many useful remarks on the condition of Sicily
in the time of Cicer03 but he is chargeable with inexactness in some
particulars. The following passage, for the accuracy of which Ι will not
vouch, relates to the population of the island (Vol. ii. p. 379): “We
have the means of estimating accurately the annual produce of wheat
in that portion of Sicily which formed the ancient kingdom of Hiero,
which paid in kind the ‘decumae’ of wheat, and the extent of which
did not comprise the third part of the island3 for Cicero informs us
in the third Verrine‚ named Frumentaria (c. 70), that the value of
the tenths of the wheat in one year, during the praetorship of Verres,
was 9,000‚OOO sesterces, which at three sesterces the modius makes
3‚000,000 modii. Cmmequently, multiplying 3,000,000 by 10, we get
for thc produce of wheat in this part of Sicily 30,000,000 modii:
405,000‚000 1ivres, poids dc marc. Now the mean of the weight of a
modius of wheat being 135 livres, and the daily consumption of wheat
by an individual being fixed at 2 livres, it is easy to deduce from it:

“ 1. The population of this portion of tho island which formed the

. former kingdom of Hicro;

“ 2. The number of Roman citizens or inhabitants of Italy maintained
by the cxportation of the wheat of Sicily, which exportation was to the
amount of 3,800‚000 modii (51,300,000 livres), including in this amount
the 800,ΟΟΟ modii of ‘ frumentum imperatum ;' this number, I say, was
in 681 of Rome, 50‚34-0 persons. The population of this third of Sicily
subjected to the payment of ‘ decumae ’ amounted to 396‚864‚ and that
