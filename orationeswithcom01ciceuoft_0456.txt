438 IN O. VERREM

cani fidem secuti sumus. Nam etsi Vaticanus optimae notae est, tamen non est cur
Regio praeponatur3 et curn pauca tantum in his duobus libris supersint ejus frag-
menta, Regius (practer lacunam in libro V) integer sit servatus, hujus auctoritatem
111 rebus levioribus ambiguique iudicii potiorem habere consentancum erat. Propter
codicis autem Regii praestantiam eas quoque varias lectiones, quae ad orthographiae
rationem pertinent, suis locis afferendas putavimus.” (Iordan.)

I. Venio nunc ad istius quemadmodum ipse appellat studium;
ut amici ejus, morbum et insaniam3 ut Siculi, latrocinium. Ego.
quo nomine appellem nescio: rem Vobis proponam: vos eam suo
non nominis pondere penditote. Genus ipsum prius cognoscite,
judices; deinde fortasse non magno opere quaeret-is quo id nomine
appellandum putetis. Nego in Sicilia tota, tam locupleti, tam vetere
provincia, tot oppidis, tot familiis tam copiosis, ullum argenteum
vas, ullum Corinthium aut Deliacum fuisse, ullam gemmam aut
margaritam, quidquam ex auro aut ebore factum, signum ullum
aeneum, marmoreum, eburneum ; nego ullam picturam neque in
tabula neque in textili, quin conquisierit, inspexerit, quod placitlun
sit abstulerit. Magnum videor dicere: attendite etiam quemad-
modum dicam. Non enim verbi neque criminis augendi causa com-
plector omnia : quum dico nihil istum ejusmodi rerum in tota pro-
vincia reliquisse, Latine me scitote, non accusatorie loqui. Etiam

1. sfudimm] Zumpt refers to Cicero,
De Invent. i. 25, for a definition of ⁵ stu-
dium :' “studium est animi assidua et
vehemens ad aliquam rem applicata magna
eum voluntate occupatio, ut philosophiae,
poeticae, geometriae, literarum.''

Corinthium dic] See Lib. 2. c. 34.

gemmam] ‘Geminae’ are precious stones,
as ‘adamas, smaragdus, beryllus, opalus,'
and many others, which Pliny, in his mul-
tifarious work (H. N. xxxvii. 4), describes.
They were used in many ways. They were
set in gold, and worn in a ring. They
were used for adorning drinking-cups (Juv.
v. 43), and for the gem-cutter to exercise
his art upon. See also e. 27.

onanqaritamfl ‘ Margarita‚' or ‘marga-
1·itum,' is the pcarl. It is mentioned
(μαργαρίτης) by Arrian (Indie. c. 8) as
being found in the. Indian scas in a shell-
fish 3 and he adds, that the name is Indian,
as we might suppose (τὸν μαργαρίτην δὴ
τὸν θαλάσσιον, οὕτω τῇ Ἰνδῶν γλώσσῃ
καλεόμενον). Pliny (H. N. ix. c. 35) treats
of pearls, an article 011 which immense sums
of money were spent in his time. He says
that he once saw Lollia Paullina covered
with pearls and emeralds 3 she wore them
all over lwr head, in her hair, in her
ears, on her neck, and her fingers. The

value of these costly ornaments was ‘ quad-

'ringenties H.S.’

tabula] The Romans sometimes used
‘tabula' absolutely for ‘pictura ;' some-
times they added ‘picta.' ‘ Pictura' is
the painting; and ‘tabula’ is the mate-
rial, which was ‘ wood.' The word ‘ textili'
is used as a noun, and means ‘eloth' or
‘calmas' Cicero however does not mean
a painting 011 canvaS, but 11 work made by
the needlc, 01· possibly woven. ‘Picta
vestis,' ‘picta ’0οςαῇ mean a dress orna-
mented with needlework.

“Non ego praetulerim Babylonos picta

superbae
Texta Semiramia quae variantur acu.'’
Martial, viii. 28.

According to Pliny (H. N. xxxv. 33),
canvas was not used to paint 011 till the
time of Nero. On ancient painting, the
reader may consult the useful article Pic-
tura, in Sinith's Dictionary of Antiquities.
The great shawl, or ‘pepluS,' which was
carried in the Panathenaic festival at
Athens, contained a representation of the
battle of the gods and the giants.

Latine] That is, ‘ simply,' ‘ plainly,'
‘literally,’ ‘in plain English? as we should
say, ‘⁶ Ut ii qui plane et Latine loquuntur '’
