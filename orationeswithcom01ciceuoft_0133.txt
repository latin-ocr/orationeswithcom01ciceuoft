AGT. ΙΙ. LIBER PRIMUS. 115

est virtutis victoriaeque jucunditas quam ista voluptas quae perpi-
pitur ex libidine et cupiditate: multo diligentius Habere dico Ser-
’ vilium praedam populi Romani quam te tua furta notata atque
perscripta.

XXII. Dices tua quoque signa et tabulas pictas ornamento
urbi foroque populi Romani fuisse. Memini: vidi simul cum
populo Romano forum comitiumque adornatum, ad speciem mag-
nifico ornatu, ad sensum cogitationemque acerbo et lugubri. Vidi
collucere omnia furtis tuis, praeda provinciarum, spoliis sociorum
atque amicorum. Quo quidem tempore, judices, iste spem maxi-
mam reliquorum quoque peccatorum nactus est. Vidit enim eos
qui judiciorum dominos se dici volebant harum cupiditatum esse
servos. Socii vero nationesque exterae spem omnium tum primum
abjecerunt rerum ac fortunarum suarum3 propterea quod casu
legati ex Asia atque Achaia plurimi Romae tuno fuerunt, qui
deorum simul-acra ex suis fanis sublata in foro venerabantur, item-
que cetera signa et ornamenta quum cognoscerent alia alio in loco
lacrimantes intuebantur. Quorum omnium hunc sermonem tum
esse audiebamus: ·“Nihil esse quod quisquam dubitaret de exitio
sociorum atque amicorum, quum quidem viderent in foro populi
Romani, quo in loco antea qui sociis injurias fecerant accusari et
condemnari 8616116111, ibi esse palam posita ea quae ab sociis per

gestum situmque membrorum ; fiyu ra circa
ornatum et habitum vestis, insignium 61
armoru1n.'' (Ascon.) So it stands in
Orelli’s text of Asconius ς but it seems to
1116 111111 ‘status’ 111111 ‘figura' should
change places.

praedam] ’1)1··10(131 was ‘that which
was taken in w· ‹·‚n and it was properly
broug³ ht into the ‘aerm'iuni,' if it was

‘eomitia,’ and these ‘comitia' were also
held there after the establislnnent of the
‘ comitia centuriata,' which were held in
the Campus Martius, and after the es-
tablislnnent of the ‘comitia tributa’
which were. held in the Forum, in its
limited sense. The most prohahle con-
clusion from 1111 the ancient authorities
seems to be that the ‘comitium’ was

money, or the 111···,6111111 of 111111 was sold
(Liv. ii. 12): if 611161· things ,a 1111116ν116
w· 118 11111110, 111111 they were ἔ86111 to Rome.
In certain cases, the‘ praeda’ was given
to the soldiers (Liv. vi. 13; x. 20).—
‘furta notata atque descripta' Orelli ς
11111 ‘perscribere' is the usual word for
writing out something, or making a list or
catalogue of things. (See 6. 35.)

22. comitiumque] “Locus propter sc-
1111111111, quo coire equitibus Romanis 01
populo Immanolicetff’ (Ascon.) This 110-
finition seems to refer to the ’ comitium '
as the place where the ‘ comitia ' were held.
The ‘ comitium ' wa* a place so called from
the‘ comitia. curiata' bring held there in
the 6· irly 1111168, 1111611 there were no other

the upper part of 1110 Forum Romanum.
lt was not a building. The matter is
discussed by Becker, Handbuch der Rom.
Alter. i. p. 273.

judiciorum dominos] An allusion, says
Asconius, to Hortensius und the other
nobles. Cicero says that their cupidity was
inflamed by the sight of the works os art,
which Verres had collected 'm Rome, and 116
was encouruged to go on with his robberies
during 1118 government os Sicily. It is cou-
jectnred by Ferracei, quoted by lilotz, that
Verres made this display during the timo
that 116 was ‘praetor urbanus,’ in which
capacity he. hud to superintend the ‘ Ludi
Apollinares?
