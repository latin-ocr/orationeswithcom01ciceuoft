in Italy. According to the observations of Professor Symonds, printed in
Arthur Young’s Travels in Italy, some lands on the great plains of Apulia
(La Puglia) produced in 1767 twelve, fifteen, and even eighteen bushels
for one. Some other parts of Italy produce ten or twelve for one3 but
these are exceptions. The Agro Romano is said to give thirteen for one.

So small a return as four for oue would not pay in all countries.
This low produce is explained by the particular circumstances. Dureau
de la Malle observes: ‘⁶ Count Prospero Balbo and M Charles Pictet‚
in their Memoires on the agriculture of Piedmont, give the proportions
between the seed and the produce, which perfectly agree with those
which Columella has transmitted to us. Their observations at the same
time explain the phenomenon of a large population, with a bad rotation
of crops, and a comparatively unskilful agriculture. The proportion
between the seed and the produce of wheat, is, according to Count Balbo,
in Piedmont‚ as one to four, and that of rye as one to nine: there are no
fallows; and they get two crops in a year. They lay little manure on
the ground, considering this nninterrupted production: but almost all
the meadovvs are fertilized by irrigation, and produce three crops of hay.
The leaves of trees are used for feeding cattle. It is especially the
excellent construction of the Piedmontese plough, which is managed by
two oxen and a man; the four or five workings which they give the land
with this plough for the cultivation of wheat, the repeated diggings for
the maize and leguminous vegetables, which, according to M. Pictet‚ are
the principa] cause of this abundance of gross products. All the land is
let at half-produce, when it grows wheat, maize, rye, rice, and silk: the
meadows alone are let at a fixed rent, which is one-half of the net
produce. The proprietor pays the taxes: the metayer (mussare) fur-
nishes the animals and the implements for ploughing: yet the propor-
tion of the crop of wheat to the seed, is, I must repeat, only four for
one. Thus in Piedmont the cultivated land at present returns, as it did
during the first six centuries of the Roman Republic, only a very small
net produee3 but it gives a very large gross produce, which supports a
very great population.’'

The author concludes by adding, that the mean prodnct of wheat in
France was estiinated at five to six sor one, in 1730, by Necker and La-
voisier; but that it is now from seven to eight, owing to the improvement
in cultivation. Arthnr Young (Travels in France in 1787—9, 2nd edit.
p. 352) also gives the average produce of Franco before the Revolntion
at six for one3 and the average produce of wheat and rye at eighteen
bushels the English acre. The produce of some districts is stated at
only four for one.. That of the fertile Liinagne of Auvcrgne is stated
by him at from seven to ten for wheat. The smallness of wheat produce
compared with the great fertility of the soil was partly explained by the
