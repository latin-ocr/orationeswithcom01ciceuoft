V. SPONSIONES.

STIPULATIONES are a Roman form of contract, made by formal words
(verbis obligatio fit). The form is by oral question and answer. He
who asks the question is said ‘ stipulari,’ and he who replies to the
question is said ‘promittere' ‘Stipulatio’ and ‘promissio’ are ac-
cordingly cor-relatives. If the person who thus becomes bound does not
perform his promise, the ‘ stipulatio ' gives to the ‘ stipulator ’ a right of
action. These are ‘stipulationes conventionales,’ which are founded
solely on the agreement of the parties.

There are also ‘ stipulationes judiciales,’ which a J udex could in some
cases impose on a defendant3 and ‘stipulationes praetoriae' (Dig. 45.
1. 53 and Dig. 46. 5, De Stipulationibus Praetoriis)‚ which are of
various kinds. One kind was used for processual purposes, and this is
the kind which will be explained here. These ‘ stipulationes’ were called
‘SponsioneS,’ because the ‘stipulator' used the word ‘ spondesP’ to
which the other party replied, ‘ spondeo.’ This form of ‘ obligatio ’ was
called Sponsio, and could only take place between Roman citizens
(Gaius, iii. 92, &c.)

This Sponsio was employed by the Praetor as the foundation of a
process. The matter in dispute was made the object of the Stipulatio.
The right of the plaintiff is the condition of the promise of the defen-
dant, who binds himself to something on the condition that the claim
of the plaintiff is just. The following is an instance from Cicero (Ad
Div. vi. 21), “quum ei dicerem tibi videri sponsionem illam nos sine
periculo facere posse, Si bonorum Turpiliae possessionem Q. Caepio
Praetor ex Edicto suo mihi dedit.” There is another example in the
oration Pro P. Quintio, c. 27. The plaintiff could sue on this Sponsio
by a Condictio. He declared that the ‘ conditio ' of the Sponsio existed,
that is, that he had a right against the defendant. In form it be·
came an action upon the ‘ obligatio ’ of the defendant arising out of the
Sponsi03 but in fact, the foundation of the action was the right of the
plaintiff. The action was in form very like the ‘actio sacramento,’ one
of the old ‘legis actiones’ (Gaius, iv. 11—31). If the object of the
Sponsio was merely to give a particular form to the process, it was
