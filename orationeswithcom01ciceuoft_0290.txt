decumas. Ooncedo; non quaero jure an injuria sint inimici.
Quid ergo illae sibi statuae equestres inauratae volunt, quae populi
Romani oculos animosque maxime offendunt propter aedem Vul-
cani? Nam inscriptum esse video quandam ex his statuam aratores
dedisse. Si honoris causa statuam dederunt, inimici non sunt:
credamus testibus3 tum enim honori tuo, nunc jam religioni suae
consulunt. Sin autem metu coacti dederunt, confiteare necesse .
est te in provincia pecunias statuarum nomine per vim ac metum
coegisse. Utrum tibi 'commodum est elige.

LXII. Equidem libenter hoc jam crimen de statuis relinquam
ut mihi tu illud concedas, quod tibi honestissimum est, aratores
tibi ad statuam honoris tui causa voluntate sua contulisse. Da
mihi hoc ε jam tibi maximam partem defensionis praecideris. Non
enim poteris aratores tibi iratos esse atque inimicos dicere. O
causam singularem! O defensionem miseram ac perditam! nolle
hoc accipere reum ab accusatore, et eum reum qui praetor in Sicilia
fuerit, aratores ei statuam sua voluntate statuisse ; aratores de eo
bene existimare, amicos esse, salvum esse cupere: metuit ne hoc

word ‘ nempe ³ generally stands at the be-
ginning of a sentence, but not always. The
word apparently is ‘nam,' with the ad-
dition of ‘ pe,' as ‘qnippe ;’ for the change
of ‘ nam ³ into ‘ nem‚’ after the addition of
‘pe,' presents 110 difficulty, and is in ac-
cordance with a law of euphony. It is that
1150 of ‘nam’ at the beginning of a 5011-
tence, by which a thing is introduced to our
notice, when there is 110 intention to dwell
upon it 3 when we intend to affirm 01· to as-
sume something that cannot be disputed,
and requires 110 argument: ‘ Weu, then,
yon say it is on account of the tenths.'
Horace (1 Sat. X. 1) has an example:

“ Nempe incomposito dixi pede currere
VCI'SUS

Lucili?

‘ It is true, I did say that the verses of Lu-
cilius move with ill-assorted step ; but that
is all that I said? Heindorf, 011 this pas-
sage, observes that ‘nempe' is always a
particle of affirmation, in the form of a
half-interrogation. He denies that it is
ever used as a word of concession, as one
of the scholiasts explains it; wherein hc is
perhaps not quite correct. As to this word
being a componnd of ¹ nam ³ and ‘ pe,’ this
view is confirmed by some of the uses of
‘ namque ³ and ‘nempe' (Ovid, Met. ii.

m. M. Creuzer and Moser adopt this
reading, and spoil it by their pointing:
‘Quid ergo? illae quid‚' διο. Iordan's
reading and pointing are the same as the
text.

aedem Vulcani ?] This temple waS, ac-
cording to tradition, founded by Romulus,
who there assembled the senate with his
partner King Tatius (Plutarch, Quaest.
Rom. c. 47). The temple was out of the
old city, but became included within it by
the extension of the ‘pomoerium.' These
gilded statues have been mentioned before,
c. 46 (Creuzer and Moser, from Garatoni).

62. relinquam ut] This use of ‘ut’
seems to have arisen from the omission of
‘ita' before ‘relinquam,' for the passage
means: ‘for my part, 1 will now willingly
give up this charge about the statues, if you
will make me this admission, that ³ 810.

O causam singularem J] Hotmann takes
‘ causam ' in the sense of πρόφασιν.

salvum esse cupere :] Klotz and Ior-
dan, on the authority of Lg. 42 p. m.,
omit ‘esse' As far as concerns the lan-
guage, we know that it can be omitted,
and thc Romans could say ‘salvum te
cupio ³ or ‘volo ' (Hor. 1 Sat. i. 812). But
it would seem pretty clear that the repeti-
tion of ‘esse' is emphatic here. The
omission of itin a single MS. is a pre-
