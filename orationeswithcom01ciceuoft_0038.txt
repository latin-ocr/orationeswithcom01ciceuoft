20 IN Q. OAEOILIUM

quum vehementius contendi impetrare, reus ut absolvatur non peto ;
sed ut potius ab hoc quam ab illo accusetur, id peto. Da mihi hoc ;
concede quod facile est, quod honestum, quod non invidiosum ; quod
quum dederis, sine ullo tuo periculo, sine infamia illud dederis, ut is
absolvatur cujus ego causa laboro. Et ait idem, ut aliquis metus
adjunctus sit ad gratiam, certos esse in consilio quibus ostendi
tabellas Velit3 id esse perfacile; non enim singulos ferre senten-
tias, sed universos constituere 3 ceratam unicuique tabellam dari cera .
legitima, non illa infami ac nefaria. Atque is non tam propter
Verrem laborat quam‘quod eum minime res tota delectat. Videt
enim, si a pueris nobilibus quos adhuc elusit, si a quadruplatoribus
quos non sine causa contempsit semper ac pro nihilo putavit, accu-
sandi voluntas ad viros fortes spectatosque homines translata sit,

sese in judiciis diutius dominari non posse.

quum vehementius contendi] Asconius
explains these words to mean ‘ quum 110011-
niam judicibus dedis and adds, that Cicero
does not say this 111 direct torms, because
he introduces Hortensius as speaking.
Klotz thinks that the false Asconius is right
—I do not.

aliquis metus, ἅμ] This sentence is not
very clear, though the general meaning is
plain. The ‘gratia' is the bribery 3 but it
was not enough to bribe, it was necessary
to 5001110 the rogue's voting as he had pro-
mised. The ‘judices' voted by ballot3 and
Hortensius is supposed to say that he has
persons among the ‘judices' who will look
at the ‘ tal)ellae,' or voting-tablets, of the
doubtful men, and see that they vote as
they have promised. The words ‘id esse
perfacile’ are not clear, and ‘ non enim‚' &c.
cannot refer to them. He says that the
‘judices' do not severally place their tablets
in the box (cista), but put them in alto-
gether 3 which is no reason why it would be
easier to see how they voted. The words
‘non enim ³ must refer to ‘ ostendi tabellas
velit? He would have the ‘ tabellae' shown
to certain trustworthy rogues among the
‘ judices,’ and this could easily be managed 3
and the reason for its being necessary is
that the ‘judices’ put their tablets in all in
a lump ; they must, therefore, show them
first, that the certain rogues might know
how the rest voted. Another reason is
added why they must show them, 111 01·(101·
that their votes may 110 known. They had
all got tablets of ‘ cera legitima,' all os one
colour, all alike, so that a man’s vote could
not be known from the colour of the
tablets, which had been given him, and on
which he must write his vote. The fact

that this infamous coloured tablet (Act. i.
0. 13) was not used, or going to be used,
on this occasion, has nothing to do with the
‘ perfacile,5 but with the ‘ostendi tabellas
velit,' which was ‘ perfacile? “You have
got your ‘ cera legitima,' ’³ says Hortensius
with a sneer, “you have the uniform
tablets, which the ‘lex' (for that is the
meaning of ‘legitima ³) requires: you have
not got that infamous and wicked tablet of
divers colours,” he adds sarcastically‚ “but
yet Ι will find out how you vote. I have
men among you, who will look after you.”

pueris nobilibus] Youngsters who be-
longed to the nobility, sons of men who
had filled curule offices. The old commen-
tator mentions the case of Appius Claudius
Pulcher, a noble youth, who accused Te-
rentius Varro (B.C. 75) of ‘ repetundae,'
and failed, owing to the management of
Hortensius, who employed these tablets of
different colours for the purpose of disco-
vering whether the ‘judices ’ whom hc
bribed, voted as they promised. See Rein,
Das Criminahecht der Riimer, p. 653.

quadruplatoribus] ‘ Quadi-uplatores ’
were probably those who undertook prose-
cutions 111 those cases in which some ‘lex '
gave them a portion of the penalty or
damages ,· as in ‘qui tam' actions in En-
gland, where a man sues for a penalty, part
for the crown, and part for himself. “ Ma-
jores enim nostri hoc sic habuerunt et ita
in legibus posuerunt, furem dupli condem-
nari, foeneratorem quadrupli,” Cato de Re
Rustica, 1. WVhatever may be the original
sense of the word, Cicero means men who
prosecute only for their own profit. See
Tacit. Ann. iv. 20 3 and Rein, Das Cri-
minahecht der Rbmer, p. 809.
