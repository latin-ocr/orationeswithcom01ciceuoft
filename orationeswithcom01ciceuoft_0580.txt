562 IN O. VERREM

post, jure imperii nostri quotannis usurpatum ac semper retentum,
summa in difficultate navium a C. Verre pretio assecuti sunt, ac
non hoc solum assecuti ne navem darent: ecquem nautam, ecquem
militem, qui aut in classe aut in praesidio esset, te praetore, per
triennium Mamertini dederunt Ρ

ΧΧΙ. Denique quum ex senatus consulto, itemque ex lege Teren-
tia et Cassia frumentum aequabiliter emi ab omnibus Siciliae civita-
tibus oporteret, id quoque munus leve atque commune Mamertinis
remisisti. Dices frumentum Mamertinos non debere. Quomodo non
debere ’.Ρ 611 ut ne venderent? non enim erat 1106 genus frumenti ex
eo genere quod exigeretur, sed ex eo quod emeretur. Te igitur
auctore et interprete ne foro quidem et commeatu Mamertini
populum Romanum juvare debuerunt. Quae tandem civitas fuit
quae deberet Ρ Qui publicos agros arant certum est quid 6 lege
censoria debeant: cur his quidquam praeterea ex alio genere im-

perasti ⁸?

usurpatum . . retentum] A better read-
ing than the old reading, ‘usurpato . . re-
tento.' ‘ Id. . usurpatum ³ means ‘ retained
by constant use ε’ there was no intermission
of the usage. ‘Usurpare,' which is sup-
posed to be compounded of ‘ 11511 ’ and
‘ rap‚' is rather a difficult word to explain
111 611 its senses. 0116 60111111011 meaning,
and the meaning herc, is to exercise a right
without interruption (Lib. 5. c. 62). But
‘ usurpatio ' has another sense, ‘ usucapionis
interruptio,' which will not apply here
(Dig. 41. 3. 2).

ac non . . solum] The old editions have
‘at non solum,> which makes these words
the defence of Verres, and at the same
time nonsense, for they contain a fresh
charge. Lambinus corrected the passage
by simply omitting ‘non3’ and then the
meaning would be, ‘ but you will say, this
is all they got from Verres, not to supply
a ship? R G 1 2 have ‘ ac non‚' the true
reading. It is a continuation of what has
been said ‚- but, as Halm remarks, if Cicero
had written in the usual way, 116 would
have added ‘ sed 116 nautam quidem dede-
runt,’ but he gives the sentence a new and
more expressive turn.

21. Terentia et Cassia] See Lib. 3.
c. 70.

omnibus . . . civitatibus] This chapter
shows that all the Sicilian ‘ civitates ' were
liable to furnish corn at a price (frumentum
emptum). See Lib. 3. 6. 6. The argument
in this chapter is liable to be misunder-
stood. Cicero says that all the ‘ civitates '

Quid decumani, num quid praeter singulas decumas ex

were liable to furnish the ‘frumentum
emptum.' If any one ‘ civitas ³ obtained a
remission, the deficiency would have to be
supplied by further demands on the rest.
Cicero says ‘Neque hoc dico ceteris non
recte imperatum 3 sed Mamertinis,' &c.
The Mamertini ought to have supplied
their share. The two modes of purchasing
are mentioned in Lib. 3. 6. 70, ‘emendi
duo genera fuerimt? From the ‘decu-
mani ² were bought the ‘alterae decumae‚’
and this was properly called ‘emptum.'
There was also the ‘emptum' which was
distributed equally among all the ‘civi-
tate5‚’ and this was properly called ‘ impe-
ratum.’ It appears then that the ‘decu-
mani' were liable both to the ‘emptum’
and the ‘ imperatum,' for Cicero says of the
‘imperatum,’ that it was required of all
alike. This ‘imperatum,’ which was re-
quired from all alike, is called by Cicero
indifferently ‘emptum ' and ‘imper-atum?

Quae tandem civitas] These words are
to be explained by a reference to ‘ debue-
runt! If the Mamertini were not bound
to supply ‘frumentum emptum,' what state
was there which owed this duty? The de-
mands on the ‘ aratores ' of the ‘ager pub-
licus ³ were fixed ς the demands on the ‘de-
cumani' were fixed; they owed ‘singulae
decumae? The ‘immunes' owed nothing
in the shape of tax. Yet Verres called on
them for ‘frumentum emptum: without
calling on the Mamertini. That was his
offence. As to ‘publicos agros? see Lib. 3.
c. 6, note.
