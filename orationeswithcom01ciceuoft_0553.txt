AOT. II. LIBER QUINTUS. 535

testimoniis eripi, ne[ve] obteri laudem imperatoriam criminibus ava-
ritiae velitis. Non possum dissimulare, judices: timeo ne G. Verres
propter hanc eximiam virtutem in re militari omnia quae fecit im-
pune fecerit. Venit enim mihi in mentem in judicio M’. Aquillii
quantum auctoritatis, quantum momenti oratio M. Antonii habuisse
existimata sit; qui, ut erat in dicendo non solum sapiens, sed etiam
fortis, causa prope perorata ipse arripuit M’. Aquillium consti-
tuitque in conspectu omnium tunicamque ejus a pectore abscidit,
ut cicatrices populus Romanus judicesque aspicerent adverso eor-
pore exceptas: simul et de illo vulnere quod ille in capite ab hos-
tium duce acceperat multa dixit, eoque adduxit eos qui erant judi-
caturi vehementer ut vererentur, ne, quem virum fortuna ex hostium
telis eripuisset, quum sibi ipse non pepercisset, hic non ad populi
Romani laudem sed ad judicum crudelitatem videretur esse ser-
vatus. Eadem nunc ab illis defensionis ratio viaque temptatur: ,.
idem quaeritur. Sit fur, sit sacrilegus, sit flagitiorum omnium
vitiorumque princeps. At est bonus imperator, at felix et ad dubia
rei publicae tempora reservandus. N on agam summo jure tecum:

tion,’ which right would be, inasmuch as
Verres was tried under a particular lex
(certa lege) and for a particular ofl'cncc
(repetundae), not to allow him to urge in
his defence that which, if true, was no
answer to this charge.

ne[ve] obteri] ‘ne obteri’ R3, Orelli,
who prefers the ἀσύνδετον, and Iordan.

M’. Aquilai] He was tried (13.0. 98)
for Repetundae. (Pro Flacco, c. 39.) His
ofl'enee was committed in Sicily, where he
put an end to the Servile war (Bao. 101).

VVhether we should write ‘Aquillius ' or
‘ Aquilius ' is doubtful. Here R and Lagg.
have ‘ Aquilii? 'she MS. of Gaius has
‘ Aquilia lex.’

M. Antonius is the great orator, who
perished in the Marian proscription. He
is introduced by Cicero (De Orat. ii. 47)
speaking of the artifice which he employed
on this occasion. Antonius was one of the
greatest masters in his profession that has
ever lived. See his remarks on his way of
dealing with a case (De Or. ii. 72).

exceptas :] ‘ acceptas ' Lg. 29.-‘ temp-
tatur' R.--‘fortuna.’ ‘Fortuna’ is the
subject of a reflexion by Caesar, Β. G. vi.
30; and see Cicero, Cat. i. c. 6, and the
note. γ

felix] ‘ Felix ' means ‘ fortunate! Sulla.
took the name of Felix. (iood ihrtnne was
part of a general’s recommendation, as we
see from the encomium on Cn. Pompeius

(De Imp. Cn. Pomp. c. 16).
summojure] ‘ l will not insist on the

utmost rigour of law,’ if ‘jure ' is here to
be taken in what some people call its ob-
jcetive sense. But it ma)v mean ‘ 1 will not

The old editions and the inferior MSS.
have ‘ constitutum ³ after ‘ sit? See Lib. 4.
c. 8, note. But it appears to be rightly
omitted on MSS. auth‹.›rit)·. Ernesti says
that ‘judicium constitutum ’ is rather said
of the first establishmcnt of a kind of trial
by a. new ‘lex,' than of the several trials
which take place according to that ‘lex.'
Madvig· hasa remark to the same effect:
“ nam judicium constitui dicitur aut quum
lege lata aut edicto, ut de re aliqua judicio
agi possit, eflicitur5 aut quum praetor ju-
dice dato rem certa ratione agi jubet.
Hoc a nostro loco alienum est; illud minus
h. l. connnode dicitur de prima const-itu-
tione judicii ;'’ for, as he adds, Cicero is
speaking of a case as tried under a certain
‘ lex? l have in this and a few other in-
stances quoted a Latin note, either because
the meaning was not quite clear to me, or
for some other reason that secmed to mo
sufficient. lt· 1 understand this right,
‘judicium constitutum certa lege ' is taken
to mean a kind or form of trial established
by a ‘ lex ;' that is, a general sorm appli-
cahle to all the cases to which it applies.
