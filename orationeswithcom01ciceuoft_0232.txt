214 IN O. VERREM

peritissimus, non possit aliter judicare3 si judicium sit ejusmodi:
L. OCTAVIVS IVDEX Esro: s1 PARET FVNDVM CAPENATEM‚ Qvo DE
AGITVR, Ex IVRE QvimnvM P. SERVILII ESSE NEQVE 1s FVNDVS
Q. CATVLO RESTITVETVR—-non necesse erit L. Octavio judici cogere
P. Servilium Q. Catulo fundum restituere, aut condemnare eum
quem non oporteat? Ejusdemmodi totum jus praetorium, ejus-
demmodi omnis res judiciaria fuit in Sicilia per triennium Verre Ὺ

DICIS, ACCVSES3 s1 PETIT, DVCAs. O. Fuficium duci jussit pe-
titorem, L. Suetium, L. Racilium. Judicia hujusmodi: Qui· cives
Romani erant, si Siculi essent, quum Siculos eorum legibus dari
oporteret; qui Siculi, si cives Romani essent—Verum, ut totum
genus amplectamini judiciorum, prius jura Siculorum, deinde istius

instituta cognoscite.

(Creuzer and Moser, 5th Excursus), and
that of Savigny, arc the same as that
which I have given. If Servilius did not
obey the unjust order, he was to be
mulcted in damages. Asconius, though
he is Pseudo-Asconius, understood the
passage. He sayS, “ J udicio suo fungatur
Balbus in Servilium, si constat fundum
Capenatem P. Servilii esse, nec restituetur
Catulo, cujus non est. Memento omnes
judices praesentes esse, quorum nominibus
utitur ad cxelnplum.”

εἰ non accipit . . petit,] Klotz reads
‘patitur,' which all the MSS. have. Cicero,
according to the text, says: ‘is he (the
creditor) does not receive what you say
that you owe, bring a charge against him :
if he sues for it, carry him off' as an ‘ad-
dictus’ Comp. the use of ‘duci’ in c. 26.
This is plain enough: ‘if the creditor
won't be satisfied with what the debtor
admits to be due, bring a charge against
him,' says Verres, ‘ and I will help you : if
he should sue for it, I will let you put him
in chains? Manutius understood it cor-
rectly. It is merely an extravagant way
of showing the iniquity of Verres, who sold
his justice. Cicero mentions instances of
creditors (petitores) who were treated in
this way. ‘ Patitur,’ the MSS. reading,
appears to be a corruption of ‘petitur,' the
reading of some editions, and ‘petitur'
must be a corruption of ‘pctit,' if that
is the true reading. If ‘patitur’ is the
true reading, the explanation of Asconius
is as good as any. He makes ‘patitur'
equivalent to ‘acc-ipit! But ‘duci jussit
petitorem ' confir-ms the reading ‘ petit?

Theod. Mommsen conjectures ‘si non

accepit,' i.e. ‘si negat se accepisse ;' which
does not mend the text at all.

Juclieia hujusmodi :] This passage
stands thus in Klotz's edition: “Judicia
hujusmodi: qui cives Romani erant, si
Siculi essent, tum si eorum legibus dari
oporteret. Qui Siculi, si cives Romani
essent? But the reading of this passage
is not certain; and Ι cannot see what is
the explanation of the text of Klotz. That
which he very confidently gives is opposed
to the interpretation of Asconius and of
Donatus on Terence (Phormio, ii. 1. 36),
whom Klotz, being in a merry mood when
he wrote his note, calls a pair of kindred
souJS.

The explanation of these old commenta-
tors, which has been hitherto followed, re-
quires the word ‘rei,' or ‘parties‚' to
be supplied in the clauses, ‘ si Siculi es-
sent? ‘si cives Romani essent,’ and Klotz
objects to this. In the words ‘judicia
hujusmodi (fuerunt)' the word ‘judices'
is implied. The passage may then be
translated thus: ‘ Those who were Roman
citizens were (erant) judiceS, if Siculi
were parties, though by their laws
Sicilians ought to have been appointed:
those who were Sicilians were appointed
(judices), if Roman citizens were par-
ties.' Asconius supposes that after ‘qui
cives Romani erant,' ‘addebantur' was to
be supplied, in which case ‘qui' would be
the nominative to ‘erant.' But the posi-
tion of ‘ erant ² and ‘essent' is against this
interpretation ,- and ‘qui cives Romani' is
only a more general form of expression
than ‘ cives Romani?
