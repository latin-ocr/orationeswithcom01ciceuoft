AGT. II. LIBER QUINTUS. 563

lege Hieronica debent P cur his quoque statuisti quantum ex 1100
genere frumenti empti darent ⁸? Quid immunes, lu· certe nihil de-
bent. At eis non modo imperasti, verum etiam quo plus darent
quam poterant, haec sexagena millia modium quae Mamertinis re—
miseras addidisti. Neque 1100 dico ceteris non recte imperatum3
sed Mamertinis, qui erant in eadem causa, et quibus superiores
omnes [praetores] item ut ceteris imperarant pecuniamque ex senatus
consulto et ex lege dissolverant, his dico non recte remissum. Et
ut hoc beneficium, quemadmodum dicitur, trabali clavo figeret, cum
consilio causam Mamertinorum cognoscit, et de consilii sententia
Mamertinis se frumentum non imperare pronuntiat. Audite decre-
tum mercenarii praetoris ex ipsius commentario, et cognoscite
quanta in scribendo gravitas, quanta in constituendo jure sit aucto-
ritas. Recita commentarium D.c.s. ‘Libenter ' ait se facere,

om nes [praetores] ] ‘ omnes ' R 3 Lg. D.c.s.must stand, Halm's pointing iswrong.

says “ ego retinui cum G. Facile scil.
excidit compendium PR.''

trabali olavo] This seems to be a pro-
verb (quemadmodum dicitur): ‘to elench
the matter,’ as we say, to fix it, and make
it sure. Horace, 1 Carm. xxxv„ has adopted
this ordinary expression :

“ Te semper anteit saeva Necessitas
Claros trabales et 01111005 manu
Gestans ahena.''

But in Carm. iii. 24 he has, as Zumpt ob—
serveS, the more poetic form, or the form
further removed from ordinary language,
‘ elavos adamantinos?

ex ipsiu-s· commutarim] ‘ from his own
note-book,’ or his notes. ‘Connnentarii,'
the plural being generally used, arc books
in which something is entered for the pur-
pose of being remembered and used when
the occasion may arise. Accordingly ‘ com-
mentarii ’ may mean ‘ tabulae acceptorum
et expensorum,' the ‘ tabulae censoriae,’
and among other things ‘ memoli-es pour
servir,’ for which we have no name, such
as Caesar’s Commentarii. See also Cic.

tentia) de Zumptii conjectura; qui tamen
titulum esse voluit ; rectius Halmius, id
quod sequentia docent, commentarii verba
esse statuit: c.s. R3 ; u.c.dett.'' (Iordan.)
Accordingly Iordun and Halm write ‘ D.b.s.
libenter ait se sac-ere? Itis possible that
these letters arc spurious; and it is pos-
sible that Hervagius' conjecture R.D. i. 0.
‘rerum decretarum ' may be right. But if

¹ Se facere ¹ has also been incorrectly made
part of the Decretum; but ‘libenter' is
the only word quoted here. D.c.s. was
the title of the Decretum, and was followed
according to Roman fashion by the names
of those who composed the ‘ consilium?
‘ Itaque perscribit’ means ‘and accord-
ingly he draws up the Decretum; as the
Romans said ‘perscribere senatusconsul-
tum ’ (Lib. 4. c. 66). Τ110 following words,
‘ ac de consilii sententia‚' no more support
Halm's opinion than the preceding words,
‘ de consilii sententia Mamertinis: &c. If
the words 1105. were omitted, ‘de con-
silii sententia,' which is 3 quotation like
‘ libenter,’ would be explained by the words
‘ cum consilio cognoscas &iz

In the first edition I said that ‘con-
silium ' had evidently two meaning-s in this
chapter. It means both the body of ud-
visers, and the thing which was done nith
their advice.

The difficulty in this passage lies 111 the
word ‘ consilium.’ The Romans used ‘ rc-
citarc ' when they spoke of pnbliely reading
something written, as a letter to the Se-
nate, a ‘senatusconsultum,' and the like.
Also they said ‘recitare testimonia: ‘to
read the evidence of witnesses which had
been taken down in writing,' where ‘ testi-
monium ' comprehcnds both the names of
the witnesses and what they said. But
the Romans could also say ‘ recitare senn-
tum: and ‘ testamento heres recitatus est:
¹ a man's nume is read out of the testamcnt
iu which he is named Heres? Accordingly
in this passage ‘ recitari consilium ' might
mean simply ‘to read the names of the
