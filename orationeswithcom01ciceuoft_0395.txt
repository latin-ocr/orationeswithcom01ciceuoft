LXIII. Decumas agri Leontini magno dicis te vendidisse.
Ostendi jam illud initio, non existimandum magno vendidisse eum
qui verbo decumas vendiderit, re et conditione et lege et edicto et
licentia decumanorum decumas aratoribus nullas reliquas fecerit.
Etiam illud ostendi, vendidisse alios magno decumas agri Leontini
ceterorumque agrorum, et lege Hieronica vendidisse, et pluris etiam
quam te vendidisse, nec aratorem quemquam esse questum; nec
enim fuit quod quisquam queri posset quum lege aequissime scripta
venderent, neque illud unquam aratoris interfuit quanti decumae
venirent. Non enim ita est ut, si magno venierint, plus arator
debeat; si parvo, minus: ut frumenta nata sunt, ita decumae
veneunt: aratoris autem interest ita se frumenta habere ut decu-
mae quam plurimo venire possint: dum arator ne plus decumam
det, expedit ei decumam esse quam maximam. Verum hoc, ut opi-
nor, esse vis caput defensionis tuae, magno te decumas vendidisse,

rae’ were persons who, after an old Ita-
lian fashion, made it a profession to
bandy jokes and sarcasms against one
another at the tables of their rich follow-
citizens. A personage of exactly the same
kind is the ’γελωτοποιός Philippus, who
appears in this character 111 the Symposium
of Xenophon. Yet the ‘ scurrae ' originally
may have been merely poor Roman citizens,
without any landcd property (Plaut. Tri-
num. i. 2. 165, ‘urbani assidui cives quos
scurras vocant ³), who attached themselves
to richer people, and were maintained by
theme—Horace, 111 the Satire above re-
ferred to, gives a sample of the ‘ scurrilitas ’
of a ‘ scurra? This Alba was a very princc
of ‘scurrae.’ His fellows called him a
‘gladiator.' 110 was a man with whom
you would not readily engage in a war of
words Finally, hc patronized Verres 111
1115 difficulties. Probably 110 had caten
some of his (linners.

appellatus sit ;] ‘ appellatus est ’ Iordan,
following Halm ς ‘ap1wllatus sit' codd.
I sec no reason why it should be ‘ sit ς’ 1101·
yet any reason why all the MSS. should
have changed ‘est ¹ into ‘ sit.'

63. dieis te] From lig. 42 φ. Orelli
has ‘ dicit se.’

Scripta venda-ena] I have followed
“ Iordan in taking ‘venderent' instead of
the former reading ‘venircntl There is

a reading ‘viderent,' which is evidently
false.

plus decumam] ‘Plus decuma' Orelli.
Lg. 42 has ‘decumam.' Compaue ‘minus
annum’ Lib. 2. 0. 49, note.

dec-mnas vendidisse, ayri vero Leontini]
After ‘vendidisse ' Zumpt 11115 ‘ atque alio-
rum quidem agrorum pro portione mag-
no decumas vendidisse? These words arc
in the second edition of Lambinus, and
Zumpt has adopted them, and also Iordan.
Lambinus says that 110 has inserted them
from an old Ms. But 110 15 evidently un-
worthy of credit, for he said in 1115 tii-st
edition that the passage was mutilated,
and that 110 had restored it according to
the authority ot· an old MS.; and yet the
lirst edition does not contain these words.
In his second edition he makes the 5111110
remark about the mutilated state of the.
passage, and about the authority of this
old MS„ and then says that these words
have been accidentally omitted by a copyist,
who passed from one ‘vendidisse ' to the
other, without notieing what lay between.
His carelessness, as Zumpt observes, mula-s
it impossible to know whether these words
were in a MS. or not. They are hardly
his own,I think. Iordan now says that
these words are in Lg. 45 F, but omitted
in the other MSS. There seems indeed lo
bc something wanted, for the words ‘ agri
