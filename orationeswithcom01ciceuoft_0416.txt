398 IN O. VERREM

solvi aratoribus, tuus apparitor parva mercede populi conductus de
aratorum bonis praedabitur P et in hac causa scribarum ordinem in
me concitabit Hortensius, et eorum commoda a me labefactari atque
oppugnari jura dicet? Quasi vero hoc scribis ullo exemplo aut ullo
jure sit concessum. Quid ego vetera repetam? aut quid eorum
scribarum mentionem faciam quos constat sanctissimos homines
atque innocentissimos fuisse i> N on me fugit, judices, vetera exempla
pro fictis fabulis jam audiri atque haberi: 111 1115 temporibus ver-
sabor miseris ac perditis. Nuper, Hortensi, quaestor fuisti. Quid
tui scribae fecerint tu potes dicere: ego de meis hoc dico, quum in
eadem ista Sicilia pro frumento civitatibus pecuniam solverem, et
mecum (11105 frugalissimos homines scribas haberem L. Mamilium
et L. Sergium, non modo istas duas quinquagesimas sed omnino
nummum nullum cuiquam esse deductum. LXXIX. Dicerem
hoc mihi totum esse attribuendum, judices, si illi unquam hoc a me
postulassent, si omnino unquam cogitassent. Quamobrem enim
scriba deducat et non potius mulio qui advexit, tabellarius cujus
adventu certiores faeti petiverunt, praeco qui adire jussit, viator
aut Venereus qui fiscum sustulit Ρ Quae pars operae aut opportu-
nitatis in scriba est cur ei non modo merces tanta detur, sed cur

cum eo tantae pecuniae part-itio fiat P—Ordo est honestus.—

79. attribuendum] He means to say
that he should have taken all the blame to
himself, if his ‘ scribae ³ had ever made such
a demand. In Lib. 5. 0. 41 there 15, (( ut
aut aliis 0311511111 calamitatis attribueret.”
But the word may be used without an 30011-
sative, and the context will explain it.

et mm potius] ‘non mulio potius qui
advexerit ' Klotz, which is the reading of
V, except that it 11115 ( plus' for ‘ potius.'——
‘non tabell? V.

petiverunt] The Siculi receive news of
the arrival of the money by the letter-car-
rier, and then go to ask for their money,
the payment for their corn. XVhen they
came, they would be called 1n or der by the

(11111000, and then they would go up to the
place where the‘ scribae were sitting, and
get their money after the ‘deductiones’
11 ere made.

‘tiator aut Venerem] See Act. i. c. 8.
It would not be making a very bold con-
jecture to suppose that all thes 0 distin-
guished functionaries received a piece of
coin for their services, from the‘ aratores!

operae] ‘qnae pars operis' Klotz from
V 3 a matter of indifference.

Ordo est honestum] Cicero calls the
‘scribae' an ( 1)1·110,’ a class, He applics to

Quis

them the same name as to the ‘ Senatorius
ordo,' ‘Equestris ordo? The subordinate
functionaries attached to the magistrates
formed a kind of corporate bodies, or guilds,
and therefore belong to the class of arti-
ficial persons. The ‘ scribae ’ were a class
who rose in number 111111 importanee with
the extension of the Roman empire. They
were employed in all branchos of the pub-
lic service3 and also, like notaries on the
continent, they did various kinds of busi-
ness for private person& The functions of
a French notary were probably very like
those of a Roman ‘scriba,' so far as concerns
his employment by private persons. Per-
sons of this class are mentioned under va-
rious names,—‘ librarii,' ‘fiscales‚' ( 0011-
5113105 ;’ but the name ‘ scribae ³ is the most
general. They were divided into ‘decu-
riae; ',and though this' 15 3 gener al term, it
came to signify, when used absolutely, ev 011
111 the Republic an period, the body of‘ scri-
bae? and it certainly 1135 this meaning in
the ’Imperial period. The members of &the
‘decuriae' were called ‘decuriati 3' later,
‘decuriales' These ‘decuriae' had no doubt
distinct names. There were ‘ scribae
quaestorii,' ‘ aedificiis ‘ praetorii‚' and
others. They existed in the other towns
