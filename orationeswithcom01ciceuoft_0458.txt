public fuuction. It was also used generally
to signify a person who is ignorant 'of‘ any
particular science or art, as opposed-to one
who is versed in it. Demosthenes (adv.
Leptin. 75, ed. Wolf> says, ‘lu’ εἷς ᾗ περὶ
τῶν ὄντων ἑκάστου νόμος καὶ μὴ τοὺς ἰδιώ-
τας αὐτὸ τοῦτο ταράττῃ καὶ ποιῇ τῶν
ἅπαντας εἰδότων τοὺς νόμους ἔλαττον ἔχειν.
See Thucydides ii. 47. Cicero here uses
a rhetorical artifice, pretending to be
alniost unacquainted even with the names
of the Greek artists. But he was fond of
works of art even at this time, and he
spent more money on them than he could
afford: “nam in eo genere sic studio
efferimur ut abs te adjuvandi, ab aliis
prope reprehendendi simus '' (Ad Att. i. 8 3
and i. 5. 11). He had when lie wrote this
letter (11.0. 67), only three years after the
supposed delivery of this speech, a ‘stu-
dium' (see 0. 1). Ι11 Lib. 4. 0. 6 again
he declares that he sets no great value on
such things: ‘Ego vero ad meam ratio⁴
nem,' &a ; but this is said oratorically.
Praxiteli] The Romans sometimes
used this form of the genitive for many of
the Greek nouns in -eS, ‘ Timarchidi' has
occurred before, Lib. 2. 0. 44, &cn As to
Praxiteles and his vim-ks, see Plin. H. N.
xxxiv. c. 83 and the article Praxiteles in
Sillig's CataloguS. The birth-place of
Praxiteles is unknown. His period is the
first part of the fourth century B.C. This
artist made statues of 1101131013, heroes, and
women; but his great glory was the
statue of Aphrodite. Cnidus possessed his
naked Aphrodite which strangers came
from far to sce. (Lucian, Ἔρωτες, 11. 397,
Hemst.) Cos had the (lraped Aphrodite.
It is probable that Praxiteles fixed the
type which became the usual mode of
representing the goddess. We have now
the Medicean Venus, a naked figure, and
the Venus of Milo, partially draped. The
Medicean may be a copy of the naked
Aphrodite. Our lady of Milo is worthy to

be an original of the great artist.
Nimirum] See 0. 57.
Cupidinem] Eros (Ἔρως) was wor-

shipped at Thespiae, a place in Boeotia,
chief of all the gods. The oldest statue of
Eros was a rude stone. Lysippus made a
bronze Eros for the Thespians, aud Praxi—
teles had previously made one of Pentelic
marble. This appears to be the statue
which Phryne got froin him (Pausan. i. 20).

Strabo (p. 410) says that Thespiae was
visited by people to see the Eros of Praxi-
teles, which the courtczan Glycera, a T hes-
pian woman, gave to her townsmen, having
received it as a present from the. artist3
and ‘iu former times people used to go “
to Thespiae to see it.' Strabo is inistaken
111 the name of the lady. All the other
authorities agree that the donor was Phryne,
of whom there was at Thespiae a statue,
also the work of her lover Praxiteles.
We might infer from Strabo's words that
the statue of Eros was not at Thespiae 111
1113 time, though this infercnce is not neces-
sary. But, according to the other autho-
rities, the statue was still at Thespiae in
Strabo's time, for Strabo did not live to the
reign of Caligula, and the emperor Caius
(that is, Caligula) first removed it from
Thespiae. Claudius gave it back ς but
Nero, the universal plunderer, carried it
off again, and it was destroyed at Rome 111
a fire, in the time of Titus, A.D. 80. (Dion
Cassius, Lib. lxvi. 0. 211, ed. Reimarus3
Pausanias, ix. 27.) The Thespians still
clung to their divinityg for Menodorus,
an Athenian, made them a copy of the
statue of Praxiteles, and this was the figure
which Pausanias saw at Thespiae, in the
second century of our aera (Pausan. ix. 27 ;
and i. 20).

Pliny (H. N. xxxvi. 0. 5, ed. Hard.) says
of Praxiteles z “ Ejusdem est et Cupido ob—
jectus a Cicerone Verri, ille propter quem
Thespiae visebantur, nuncin Octaviae scho-
lis positus.'’ Pliny also mentions another
Cupido by Praxiteles, at Parium, on the
Propontis ; and he speaks of this Cupido as
being at Parium when he wrote. Pliny’s
text is either corrupt, or this is an instance
of his carelessness 3 for he clearly says that
the Cupido which Verres was charged with
taking, was the Cupido which people used
to go to Thespiae to see, aud which in his
time was in the. Scholae of Octavia. But
the Cupido of Heius was not that of Thes-
piae. It was either the statue from Pa-
rium, or a third work of Praxiteles, 01·
what is more likely than either supposi-
tion, a copy of one of the Cupids of the
great master. Sillig (Catalogus Artificum)
supposes that the Cupido of Heius was the
Parian statue, which he conjectures had
been carried off by some Roman procon-
sul, and had come to the hands of Heius.
He adds, that Pliny's authority reinains in-
