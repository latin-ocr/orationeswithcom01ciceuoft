608 IN O. VERREM

sibi auctoritatis in re publica suscepit ut, quibus hominibus per
senatum, per populum Romanum, per omnes magistratus, in foro,
in suffragiis, in hac urbe, in re publica versari liceret, iis omnibus
mortem acerbam crudelemque proponeret, si fortuna eos ad aliquam
partem Siciliae detulisset. Ad Cn. Pompeium, clarissimum virum
et fortissimum, occiso Perperna permulti ex illo Sertoriano numero
militum confugerunt. Quem non ille summo cum studio salvum
incolumemque servavit? cui civi supplici non illa dextera invicta
fidem porrexit et spem salutis ostendit? Itane vero quibus fuit
portus apud eum quem contra arma tulerant, iis apud te cujus
nullum in re publica momentum unquam fuit mors et cruciatus
erat constitutus P Vide quam commodam defensionem excogitaris7
LIX. Malo mehercule id quod tu defendis his judicibus populoque
Romano quam id quod ego insimulo probari: malo, inquam, te isti
generi hominum quam mercatoribus et naviculariis inimicum atque
infestum putari. Meum enim crimen avaritiae te nimiae coarguit:
tua defensio furoris cujusdam et immanitatis et inauditae crudeli-
tatis et paene novae proscriptionis. Sed non licet me isto tanto
bono, judices, uti: non licet. Adsunt enim Puteoli toti: frequen-

(Lib. 1. c. 12, &c.). He was the ‘ quaes-
tor ' of Carbo, and in this capacity he de-
serted him : he transferred his ⁴ quaestor-

seems nothing more strange in calling

in saffiayiiffi] Not access to the ‘ma-
gistratusj however, says P. Manutius, for
a ‘lex’ which was passed (B.C. 81) after
the victory of Sulla deprived the sons of
the proscribed of the capacity of filling
‘ magistratus? Cicero (In Pison. c. 2) op-
posed the repeal of this unjust lex. Com-
pare Velleius, ii. 283 Sallust, Cat. c. 37.

Perperna] M. Perperna, who belonged
to the faction of M. Aemilius Lepidus,
joined Sertorius in Spain, and afterwards
assassinated him (Plutarch, Sertorius, c.
27). Cn. Pompeius, who was then con-
ducting the war in Spain, caught Perperna
and put him to death (13.C. 72) 3 but he
burnt all the papers of Sertorius without
reading them, or letting any one else read
them ; “ and hc immediately put Perperna
to death, through fear that there might be
defection and disturbance if the names
were communicated to others³² (Plutarch).
—- ‘permulti occiso Perperna ex illo :'

Verres was, that he had caught and put to
death the partizans of Sertorius. Cicero's
charge is, that they were ‘mercatores '
whom he had plundered. This was the
‘ crimen avaritiae.’ Cicero would have had
110 objection, if Verres could have proved
his case, that they were partizans of Ser-
torius whom he had punished 3 for Verres
would then have proved that he almost
made a new proscription. But Cicero goes
011 to say that he cannot avail himself of
this advantage3 he cannot have the oppor-
tunity of letting Verres prove himself to be
merely a bloodthirsty villain, for the evi-
dence of many persons established the fact
that these were ‘mercatores ' whom 110
plundered of their goods.

Puteoli] This town, now Pozzuoli, was
a great place of resort for merchants from
Asia and Egypt 3 and Verres had inter-
cepted many of those who were bound to
this port, plundered them of their wares,
and put them to death. The ancient navi-
gation required more stoppages than ours,
and these vessels had called at Syracuse,
probably for water and other conveniences.
When St. Paul left Malta after his ship-
wreck, he sailed in a vessel of Alexandria,
which stayed three days at Syracuse. The
