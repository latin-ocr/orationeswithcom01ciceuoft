JUDICIA. 51

who were empowered to act as a special commission. The appointment
of such special eommissions by the Senate was apparently an encroach-
’ ment on the popular power, and the establishment of a Quaestio Per-
petua was nothing more than the giving of a regular form to what was
done occasionally. As the higher personages of the State were chiefly
the objects of criminal prosecutions, the Senate would be inclined to
secure as far as possible the jurisdiction over those who were either
members of their own body or connected with those who were. In a γ,
Quaestio Perpetua the J udices were still the Senators, a certain number
of whom were annually selected by the Praetor, as it appears, and their
names were entered on a list, the Album Judicum Selectorum. Out of
this body were taken by lot the requisite number of Judiees for each
trial. The Senators were often partial judges in the case of members
of their own body3 and the Populares or popular leaders attempted to
wrest from them their judicia] power. The Lex Sempronia, Rc. 122, of
C. Gracchus, took away the judicial power from the Senator-s and gave
it to the Equites, from which body the Praetor was required to take the
Judices. According to Cicero the people were satisfied with the Equites.
But in trials for Repetundae nothing was gained by the change, for the
governors in the provinces winked at the exactions of the Publicani,
who belonged to the equestrian order, the object of the governors being
to secure the favour of that body from whom their Judices must be
chosen, if they were ever prosecuted for mal-administration (Cic. Verr.
Act. ii. Lib. 3. c. 41). The Lex Servilia Caepionis, B.c. 106, repealed
the Lex Sempronia3 but the Lex Servilia Glaucia Repetundarum again
excluded the Senators from the Judicia1. This Lex did not give the
Judicia to the Equites in express ternis, but it accomplished this object
by excluding others. The Praetor had the power of naming 450 Judices,
but he could not name any person who was or had been Tribunus Plebis,
Quaestor, Triumvir Capitalis, Tribunus Militum in one of the first four
legions, or Triumvir agris dandis assignandis, or any one who had been
or was iu the Senate, any person who was Infamis, any person who was
under thirty or above sixty years of age, any person who did not reside
in Rome or in the immediate neighbourhood, any father, brother, or son
of any person who was or had been a member of the Senate, or any
person who was absent beyond seas. M. Livius Drusus, Tribunus
Plebis, proposed and carried a Lex «Iudiciaria, 13.c. 91, which distributed
the judicial power between the Senate and the Equites; but the Senate
declared this and all the other Leges Liviae invalid on the ground of not
