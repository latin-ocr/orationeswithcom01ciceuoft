AOT. ΙΙ. LIBER PRIMUS. 143

Quam postea tu tibi defensionem relinquebas, in ea maxime offen-
· disti, quum tuam auctoritatem tute ipse edicto provinciali repu-
diabas.

XLIV. Atque ego non dubito quin ut mihi, cui filia maxime
cordi est, res haee acerba videatur atque indigna, sic unicuique
vestrum qui simili sensu atque indulgentia filiarum commovemini.
Quid enim natura nobis jucundius, quid carius esse voluit, quid est
dignius in quo omnis nostra diligentia indulgentiaque consumatur ⁴?
Homo importunissime, eur tantam injuriam P. Annio mortuo fecisti Ρ
0111· huncdolorem cineri ejus atque ossibus inussisti, ut liberis ejus
bona patria, voluntate patris, jure, legibus tradita eriperes, et cui
tibi esset commodum condonares? Quibuscum vivi bona nostra
partimur, iis praetor adimere nobis mortuis bona fortunasque pote-
rit? NEC PETITIONEM, inquit, NEC POSSESSIONEM DABo. Eripies
igitur pupillae togam praetextam ⁶? detrahes ornamenta non solum

Verres had framed his decrees upon the ‘ur-
banum edictum,’ it could not be said that
the ‘ urbanum edictum’ was repealed by the
Siciliense. In the beginning of e. 46, Cicero
observes that V erreS, as in the case of
‘ mulierum hereditates? 50 111 that of ‘ here-
ditatum possessiones,' had not transferred
the chapters of his ‘ urbanum edietum' into
the ‘ provinciale ' (cur . . . transferre no

lueris) ; and he says nothing of vermi
making his ‘decreta' as to Such matters,
under any circumstances, eonfinanably to
the ‘ urbanum,' but 110 assumes that these
chapters were to have 110 effect at all.

He asks (c. 46), ‘ Did you think that the
inhabitants ofthe province had a better title
than ourselves to the enjoyment of “aequum
jus ?” ' If Cicero had said that Verres in-
tended (voluit) 111 cases not provided for, if
such arose, to make 1115 ‘ decreta ' in confor-
mity to the ⁴ urbanum edictum,' that is, the
inequitablc chapters of it, hc would have
been destroying his own argument, which
is, that Verres totally rejected these repre-
hensiblc chaptcrs of his ‘ urbanum edictum?
‘ Ex improviso' must he explained by refer-
ence to ‘ provideri ’ at the end of e. 41 ; 111111
the sense of the passage 15 this: ‘you did
not ehoosc in extraordinary cases to apply
to your urban edict? The end of this
chapter proves clearly that ‘ noluisti ’ must
be read, for Cicero sayS, ‘ 'Phe future de-
fence which you were reserving,r for your-
self, was a. matter in which you made the
greatest blunder, when by your provincial
edict you repudiated your own precedent?
‘ Vol’ and ‘ nol ’ are often confounded.

44. cuifilia] Cicero alludes to his daugh-
ter Tullia, who was probably born B.C. 79
or 78. See e. 58, ‘habemus enim liberos,'
&cn—‘cui mea filia . . . videtur' V, Klotz,
and Iordan.

bona fortunasque] See note 011 ‘bona '
and ‘ fortunas} Divin. c. 20. ‘ Fortunam ³
is used in the singular by Scaevola (Dig. 4.
7. 40), “ argentarius coactor totam fortu-
nam in nominibus habebat :’' he had 1111 1115
money invested 111 1011115, or out in some
way.

pelc'lc'onem,] The praetor declared that
he would not allow her to sue (petere) for
the ‘hereditas ς’ for, in the 111150 of an ‘in
rem actio‚' one of the modes of proceeding
was ‘per formulam petit‹n·iam‚’ in which
the plaintiff (actor) claimed the thing 115
1115 property (11111115, iv. 91, 92), “ Petitm-ia
autem formula haec est, qua actor intendit
rem suam esse.” Nor would the praetor
allow her to take possession of the ‘here-
ditas ς’ which possession would not of its-clf
have conferred a legal title, though the
praetor treated ‘ bonorum possessores ' as
‘ heredes?

{offam praetendam 3] The ‘toga prae-
texta' was worn both by males and 111111111115 3
by boys till they assumed the ‘ toga 1·11·111“5,’
and by girls till they were married. As tho
‘toga’ was the elenau-torisa<- 111-1155 of the
Romans, Cicero means to say, that the con-
duct ot' Verres was equivalent to depriving
the girl of her citizenship, to stripping her
even of the signs of her free birth (ingenu-
itus), treating her as a slave, 115 a person
without rights.
