courts retaining their old practice and their original constitution, with-
out being capable of adapting themselves to the alterations in the social
state and to the changes in the habits of the Romans. People‚ if left
alone, can find out what they want better than any legislator ; and there
are few countries at the present day in which the old courts would not
be soon superseded by something better suited to the wants of the
people, if the free development of a nation's activity was not fettered by
those who hold power, and particularly by those who are intercsted in
maintaining existing forms of procedure. The notion of justice, which is
in all people, and is developed by their social progress, finally led the
Romans to the transferring of the Officium Judicis to private personS‚
named for the occasion, and generally in each case to a single person.
In certain caseS‚ several Judices were'appointed‚ under the name of
Recuperatores, whose functions appear to have been limited to particular
kinds of actions. It does not belong to the present inquiry to explain,
how the Magistratus controlled and directed a J udex in the hearing and
determining of a case. The references at the end will give the necessary
information on this matter to those who will take the pains to look
for it.

Many persons would naturally (natura) be excluded from the Officium
Judieis‚ as idiotS‚ deaf people, and Iinpuberes3 or by custom, that is,
opinion in a persistent form (moribus), as women, slaves ; 01· by special
rule, as Infames (Dig. 5. 1. 12). It does not follow that all who were
not specially excluded had the capacity of acting as Judex3 and the
Praetor might by virtue of the power of his office extend the exceptions.
Yet the nature of the institution of a Judex seems to require that there
should be the frecst possible selection of persons ; and this was particu-
larly so in the case of that class of Judices who were called Arbitri (see
Cicero, Pro Rosc. Com. c. 4, and Top. 17) ; and apparently in the case of
Recuperatores also. There were two classes of Arbitri; audone class
were those who by the Formula were empowered to decide what one party
should do or make good to another ⁴ ex fide bona‚' or ‘ quantum aequius
melius id dari‚’ or ‘ ut inter bonos agier oportet.' This class of actions
was finally comprehendcd under the name of ‘ bonae fidei judicia.' Tho
Romans had a tact for legal precisi0n3 but they had likewise a nice
sense of what is just. They knew that many of the transactions of life
cannot be bound down to the rigid formulae of a legal rule. Our legal
formalists can see nothing beyond the narrow circle within which they
intrench themselves. lt· the case in hand does not fit their formula, 110
legal redrcss for a wrong which tho common understanding (communis
sensus) of mankind pronounces to be a wrong, no legal establishnient of
a right, which the like sense pronounces to be one. By means of their
‘ bonae fidei judicia,' the Romans kept a mean between the refusal of
