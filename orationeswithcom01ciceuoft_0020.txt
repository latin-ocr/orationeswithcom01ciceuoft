that Carbo, then consul for the third time, was in Cisalpine Gaul, and
this must be the year in which Verres was his quaestor. In his capacity
of quaestor Verres was treacherous to the consul, and also embezzled
the public money. (Act. ii. Lib. l. c. 13—16.) After the defeat and
death of Carbo, whom Cn. Pompeius caught in Sicily (13.0. 82) and put
to death, Verres joined Sulla's party. Sulla sent him to Beneventum,
probably to be out of the way, and he gave him certain estates which
had belonged to the proscribed of Beneventum. He paid Verres, says
Cicero, for his treachery, but he would not trust him. Verres soon
found fresh employment. Cn. Cornelius Dolabella, praetor of Cilicia
(13.0. 80, 79), an unprincipled, greedy fellow, made Verres one of his
legati3 and, after the death of the quaestor C. Malleolus, he appointed
him proquaestor. The governor and his quaestor were a worthy pair,
who kept one another in countenance. Cicero (Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 17,
Sto.) has given a lively sketch of this period of the administration of
Verres. He betrayed Dolabella as he had betrayed Carbo. When
Dolabella was prosecuted (13.0. ’78) by M. Aemilius Scaurus for repe-
tundae, Verres, his companion in knavery, bargained with the accuser
for his own safety on the terms of giving evidence against his old master.

(Act. i. c. 4: Lib. 1. c, 38.) Hortensius defended Dolabella, but he was
convicted and went into exile.

Verres had enriched himself in Asia, and he is said to have used his
wealth in buying votes when he was a candidate for the praetorship.
He was praetor in B.c. 74, and had the urbana jurisdictio. Under his
praetorship (Lib. 1. c. 40, Sto.) justice was sold, and the praetor’s
interest was purchased by applying to his mistress Chelidon. Cicero,
gives many instances of the praetor’s greediness and unscrupulous ways of
getting money. In Rc. 73 Verres obtained the propraetorship of Sicily,
one of the most fertile of the Roman provinces, and the most abundant
in works of art. The governor did not neglect this opportunity of filling
his pockets with Sicilian gold, and his house with the choicest works of
the Greek artists. Verres held the government of Sicily for three
yearS, owing to the praetor Q. Arrius, who ought to have taken his
place at the close of the year Bb. 7 3, being engaged in the war against
Spartacus. (Lib. 4. c. 20.) He went to Sicily, says Cicero, with the
settled purpose of plundering it, and neither the contest between the
Romans and the Carthaginians for the possession of Sicily, nor the two
servile warS, had caused so much misery in the island as the misgovern-
ment of a Roman praetor. Verres ruined the corn-growers, beggared
the farmers-general (publicani), and robbed both temples and private
houses of the works of art, which the Greeks of Sicily prized even more
than their money. Cicero has treated of the Sicilian government of
Verres under four heads: his administration of justice (Lib. 2); his
