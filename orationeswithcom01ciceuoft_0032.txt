14 ΙΝ Q. CAECILIUM

bunicia potestas efflagitata est; judiciorum levitate ordo quoque
alius ad res judicandas postulatur; judicum culpa atque dedecore
etiam censorium nomen, quod asperius antea populo videri solebat,
id nunc poscitur, id jam populare et plausibile factum est. In
hac libidine hominum nocentissimorum, in populi Romani quoti-
diana querimonia, judiciorum infamia, totius ordinis offensione,
quum hoc unum his tot incommodis remedium esse arbitrarer, ut
homines idonei atque integri causam rei publicae legumque susci-
perent, fateor me‘salutis omnium causa ad eam partem accessisse
rei publica-e sublevandae quae maxime laboraret.

Nunc quoniam quibus rebus adductus ad causam accesserim
demonstravi, dicendum necessario est de contentione nostra, ut in
constituendo accusatore quid sequi possitis habeatis. Ego sic in-
telligo, judices: quum de pecuniis repetundis nomen cujuspiam
deferatur, si certamen inter aliquos sit cui potissimum delatio detur,
haec duo in primis spectari oportere; quem maxime velint actorem
esse ii quibus factae esse dicantur injuriae, et quem minime velit is
qui eas injurias fecisse arguatur. IV. In hac causa, judices,
tametsi utrumque esse arbitror perspicuum, tamen de utroque
dicam, et de eo prius quod apud vos plurimum debet valere, hoc
est, de voluntate eorum quibus injuriae factae sunt, quorum eausa

it should mean less than ‘ difficultatibus?
The Romans often use ‘ incommodum,' and
in many cases it means a great deal more
than we should suppose that it meant, if we
looked to its etymologica] sense only. In
Act. ii. Lib. 3. c. 50 it means ‘ loss.' Cacsar
often uses the word 111 the sense of a
‘defeat' (i. 13; vii. 29).

ordo quoque alius] The ‘ordo equestris'
and the ‘ tribuni aerarii, ’ to whom with the

‘senatoies 'the Lex Aurelia of Β. c. 70 gave

the Judicial authority, which at the trial of
Verres was in the hands of the‘ senatores’
only. (See Introduction.)

censorium nomen] According to the
Schol. Gronov„ p. 384, ed. Orelli, Sulla
abolished the censorship. However this may
be, there were no censors from the dictator-
ship of Sulla to B.C. 70, the first consulship
of Cn. Pompeius Magnus. The last lustrum
preceding that of ΒΕ. 70 was in B.c. 86.

plausibile] That which merits ‘plau-
dite: the word with which the Roman
comedi au generally concluded his play 5, and
by 11111(11 he solicited the applause of the
slywct 115.ῒο1 W e h 11 6 no equiv· ‹ll-ent w·301d
for‘ plausible’ is a (liffeient thing.

offensio] In Acts 1. c. 12, there occurs,

‘in odium offensionemque populi Romani
irruere,' where ‘ offensio ' is the feeling, the
aversion, and disgust of the subject which
is expressed by the genitive case. The ex-
pression ‘pedis offensio? the striking of the
foot against an obstacle, shows the primary
sense of the word. Here the ‘totius ordinis
offensio ' is the stumbling of the Senatorian
ordo, their impinging on something, their
false, unsteady step. See ‘ offensione: c. 7
and 13.

nomen cujuspiam deferatur-Q ‘Nomen
deferre,’ or simply ‘ deferre,’ in one of its
senses, means to accuse, but only by virtue
of its implication with the context3 for
‘ deferre ' also means to hand in or give in
a man’s name with the view of doing him a
service, as in Cicero (Pro Balbo, c. 28),
“ Caesar in praetura, in consulatu praefec-
tum fabrum detulit.” See the use of ‘rem
defert,' Act. ii. Lib. 2. c. 71. In the sense
of bringing a charge we have the words

‘delatio,³ ‘ delator.²

cujuspiam] In the next chapter we
have ‘ cujusquam? There seems little doubt
that the terminations ‘piam ' and ‘ quam ’
are the same. The MSS. have often both
in the same passage.
