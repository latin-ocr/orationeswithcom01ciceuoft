viii - PREFACE.

by J. C. Orelli, Leipzig, 1831. The text of this oration has
been carefully and judiciously rovisod by the editor. Orelli used
for this edition two collations of the Codex Regius of the ninth
century, N. 7774. A. 1; one collation is the “Havniensis‚'' or
Copenhagen collatio, which is contained in the Epistola Critica
of Madvig3 the other was made for Orelli, at Paris, by a learned
youth (eruditus juvenis) of Basle, named Hanhart. Orelli also
used a new and accurate collation of the Cod. Leidensis, pre-
sented to him by Bake; the fragments of the Vatican Palimp-
sest of Mai3 and a MS. of St. Gallen. These MSS. are re-
ferred to by Orelli under the following abbreviations z—R.‚ Codex
Regius3 L., Leidensis; V„ Palimpsestus Vaticanus3 G„ Codex
Sangallensis. The labours of Zumpt, Orelli, and Madvig, have
probably settled the text of this oration as well as it can be
settled.

The Opuscula Academica of J. N. Madvig, Copenhagen, 1834,
contain an essay, entitled “De locis aliquot Ciceronis orationum
Verrinarum dissertatio critica.'’ It is referred to several times
in these notes.

With respect to the commentary of Asconius on part of these
orations, which I have often cited, Ι have used the text of OreHi's
edition of Cicero. This commentary contains both good and bad
matter3 and in its present shape it is not the genuine commen-
tary of Asconius. This subject has been well examined by Madvig
in his essay, “ De Q. Asconii Pediani et aliorum veterum inter-
pretum in Ciceronis orationes Commentariis Disputatio Critica,

Copenhagen, 18:28st

It was my intention, conformably to the plan of this series
of editions, to take a text such as Zumpt's, and merely to make
notes 011 it. But a careful study of these orations convinced
me that Ι could not adopt any one text. Though this has no
protensions to be a critical edition, the text has cost me a
great deal of labour3 and that kind of labour which is not seen.
In many passageS‚ I have no doubt that the text which I have
