AOT. II. LIBER SECUNDUS. 291

Verrutium. Ego instare ut mihi responderet quis esset, ubi esset,
unde esset3 cur servus societatis qui tabulas conficeret semper in
Verrutii nomine certo ex loco mendosus esset. Atque haec pos-
tulabam, non quo illum cogi putarem oportere ut ad ea mihi
responderet invitus, sed ut omnibus istius furta, illius flagitium,
utriusque audacia perspicua esse posset. Itaque illum in jure metu
conscientiaque peccati mutum atque exanimatum ac vix vivum
relinquo: tabulas in foro summa hominum frequentia exseribo:
adhibentur in exscribendo de conventu viri primarii: literae liturae-
que omnes assimulatae, expressae, de tabulis inlibros transferuntur.
Haec omnia summa cura et diligentia recognita et collata et ab
hominibus honestissimis obsignata sunt. Si Carpinatius mihi tum
respondere noluit, responde mihi nunc tu, Verres, quem esse hune
tuum paene gentilem Verrutium putes. Fieri non potest ut, quem
video te praetore in Sicilia fuisse et quem ex ipsa ratione intelligo
locupletem fuisse,beum tu in tua provincia non cognoveris. Atque
adeo, ne hoc aut longius aut obscurius esse possit, procedite in
medium, atque explicate descriptionem imaginemque tabularum,
ut omnes mortales istius avaritiae non jam vestigia sed ipsa cubilia
videre possint.

LXXVIII. Videtis VERRUTIUM‘? videtis primas literas integras?
videtis extremam partem nominis, caudam illam verrinam tam-

Cicero’s statement, and more intelligible.
-—‘ ad ea :’ ‘ad' is from V, and perhaps
properly added.

in jzgre] ‘ before the praetor.'
3· icn {3}(3glt,g;2d0] This passage is worthy

servus] There is no reason why this
should not be taken literally to signify a
slave who was employed in keeping ac-
counts. Hotmann supposes the ‘servus
societatis' to bc one who ‘Syracusis ope-
ram dabat societati‚’ as opposed to the

Sec Lib.

‘magister‚’ an absurd explanation. Manu-
tius says the same, and adds that the
‘ servus ' is Carpinatius, ¹ Cave credideris?
—‘ qui tabulas confecerit ’ is, according to
Iordan, the reading of all the MSS. except
Lg. 42 p. m„ which has ‘ qui tabulas con-
ficeret.’ As both expressions are Latin,
and no MSS. evidence is decisive in such a
case, we must determine by other reasons
which reading we will take, and this is not
difficult to do. ‘Qui . . confecerit ' is thc
man who kept the accounts, made the
eum-ies, the particular entries of which
Cicero is speaking. ‘ Qui . . conficeret ' is
the book-keeper; and the imperfect con-
sists with the other parts of the sentence.
certo ea: loco] ‘beginning from a cer-
tain place in the entries? Klotz, from V,
has ‘ certo in loco,' which Creuzer und
Moser take to be the true reading. But
‘certo ex loco’ is quite as consistent with

of note, as showing the way in which docu—
mentary evidence was secured when the
originals could not be produced at the trial.
In this case there was an exception in fa-
vour of the ‘publicani’ They were not
compelled to produce their books. Ac-
cordingly copies were made and attested.
—‘de conventu' seems better than ‘ex
conveutu‚’ which Klotz has from V.

ffmztilem] The resemblance between
Verres and Verrutius is the foundation of
this remark of Cicero, though Verres was
not a gentile name.
