we can easily suppose that the ‘heredeS,' or
as we should say, the personal represen-
tatives of a deceased lessee would be en-
titled to the remainder of an unexpired
lease. But if we admit that the land was
leased, this is all. The ternis of the leases
are unknown. Becker further remarks
that the ⁶ decumae ¹ of the Leontine land
were not let in Rome, but in Sicily, and
conformably to the Lex Hieronica. He
concludes that the words ‘is ager . . solet'
refer to the leasing of these lands by the
censorS, and this was done every Lustrum,
when any of the lands happened to be
vacant. Accordingly this Sicilian land
was dealt with exactly as the Campanus
Ager in Italy was. Finally, he adds, that
this explains how the Leontine land, though
it was originally given back to the Leon-
tini without sale, gradually came into
other hands.

Ι am inclined to think that Cicero does
mean that the lands of these states were
let at Rome. But the. explanation of ‘ red-
ditus’ is not easy. The restoration would
be of course. to the former owners, who
would be owners no longer, but tenants
under a lcase. Only one family of Leon-
tini now occupied a farm in the territory,
but the fact osone family remaining helps
to explain the word ‘ redditus? We may
suppose that all the rest, for some reason,
which is not explained, had ccased to
occupy these lands under the Roman state.
Cicero's statement, which is obscure to us,
may have been clear to his countrymcn.

Mamertina] The Civitas Mamertina
was Messana, now Messina, on the north-
east coast of Sicily, and on the straits, a
city whose various soi-tunes require a sepa-
rate history (Lib. 2. c. 5). 'rho original
town Zancle, or Dankle, as thc name ap-
pears on the oldest coins, took the name of
Messana when it was occupied by Messe-
nians from Rhegium (Thueyd. vi. 5). ln
B-C. 282 it fell into the hands of the Ma-
mertini (Polyb. i. 7), and hence it is some-
times ealled Mamertina. Pliny (iii. 8. 14)
caus it ‘ oppidum civium Romanorum ς’

but it must have been made such after the
time of Cicero. In this passage Cicero
omits the ‘ Netina civitasss which he calls
‘foederata' (Lib. 5. c. 51). The Netini
had the same grounds for their ‘foedus'
with Rome as the Mamertini (Lib. 5. c.
22).

z'nmzmzes ac liberam] These five cities
were ‘immunes et liberae.' Their ‘liber-
tas' consisted in having magistrates of
their own, and being free from the govern-
ment of the praetor in most matters ι the
‘immunitas ’ was an exemption from pay-
ing taxes to the Roman State. Cicero
says of the ‘foederatae civitates '—‘ qua-
rum decumae venire non soleant‚’ where
‘non soleant' seems by the form of ex-
pression to imply that this was incident to
a ‘ foedus? He says of the five, that they
were ‘immunes et liberae' without a ‘ foe-
dus,’ meaning apparently that they had
the same advantages as the ‘ibederatae,’
though they had no ‘foedusf Becker
affirms that the possession of ‘libertas'
only did not confer freedom from taxation
(inununitas), unless this ‘ inununitas ' was
expressly granted. l do not know whether
this is true or not.

The words ⁴ Praeterea. omnis,’ &c.,
seem somcwhat ambiguous. Cicero says
of the two foederato vities, and we must
suppose the same remark to apply to the
third, which he does not mention here,
that their ‘decumae' were not let by
the censors. He does not in direct ternis
say that they puid no ‘decunnieff Five
citics besides were ‘immunes ac liberae,’
though they had no ‘foedus’ lle then
says ‘ Praeterea onmis-,⁹ which is explained
to mean that all the eities were ‘decu-
manae‚' except those to which the ‘censo-
ria loeatio' applied, and the seven (or
eight) citios. If the order of the words
were ‘ Omnis praeterea ager,' the meaning
would seem to be more clearly expresscd.
But the difficulty which l have hinted at
may be only imaginary. Caesar writes
(B. G. i. 40), ‘Quod si praeterea nemo
sequatur,’ ἃς.
