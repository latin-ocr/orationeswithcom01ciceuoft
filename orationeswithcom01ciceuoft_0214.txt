196 SPONSIONES.

trium, Sec„ Vol. i. p. 30). The plaintisf, when he accepted the Sponsio,
was said ‘sponsionem acceptam facere ’ (Lib. 3. c. 60) ¹.

The expression ‘ lege ageret ' (Lib. l. c. 45, and the note) is thus cx-
plained by Savigny (System, &c., v. p. 30, δῖα). Gaius (iv. 95) states
that in his time there were two modes of proceeding by the Formulae,
the Formula Petitoria, and the Sponsio; and there was also the proceed-
ing before the Centumviri : “ Ceterum si apud Centumviros agitur,

summam sponsionis non per formulam petimus, sed per legis actionem ; ’

sacramento enim reum provocamus.’' In the passage in Lib. 1. c. 45,
we must suppose that Cicero by ‘ lege ageret' means a proceeding
before the Centumviri, which mode of proceeding, and that by the
Sponsio, he considered to be the only two forms applicable to a disputed
succession. In other actions, where ownership was in dispute, the pro-
ceeding might be by the F ormula Petitoria, of which Cicero (Lib. 2. c.
12) gives the form, which form agrees precisely with that in Gaius. The
history and constitution of the court of Centumviri are a very obscure
subject. This court certainly had cognizance ef claims to disputed suc-
cessions‚ was an old court, and was in existence even as late as the time
of Gaius. It is frequently mentioned in the letters of the Younger
Pliny. (See the Article CENTUMVIRI, Dict. of Antiqs.) The applica-
tion of the Formula Petitoria appears in Lib. 2. c. 12. Zumpt, in his
note on the passage ‘lege ageret’ (Lib. 1. c. 45), simply refers to the
passage of Gaius (iv. 91) : “In rem actio duplex est; aut enim per for-
mulam petitoriam agitur aut per sponsionem,’' &Q But Savigny’s ex-
planation is the true one. ‘Lege agere’ in this passage refers to a
‘legis actio 3’ for it appears that all the ‘legis actiones ’ were not abo-
lished by the Lex Aebutia. But ‘lege agere’ is also used in a more
general sense, for Cicero says (Lib. 2. c. 16), ‘ Quis unquam isto prae-
tore Chelidone invita lege agere potuit ?’ where ‘lege agere ’ is certainly
not limited to a ‘legis actio ς’ nor is it in Divin. c. 5.

With respect to the ‘ beati possidentes ' of Zumpt (Act. ii. Lib. 1, note
on ‘ Si possessor ’)‚ we may compare the vulgar expression, that posses-
sion is nine-tenths of the law. There are in fact legal essays with the
title ‘beati possidentes,’ or ‘de commodis possessionis.’ The practical
advantage of having the possession of a thing is indeed well known. In
the case of the disputed ownership of property, he who is in possession
has this advantage, that his opponent must prove a title to the property
in order to turn him out3 and the possessor gains his cause, that is, he
remains undisturbed in possession, if no title can be made out by any
other person. This is, however, no special beatitude of a possessor, for
every person who makes any claim against another must prove it3 aud
