520 IN C. VERREM

mininus ita ex aede sua sustulit ut in Capitolio, hoc est, in terrestri
domicilio J ovis poneret. Quod autem est ad introitum Ponti, id,
quum tam multa ex illo mari bella emerserint, tam multa porro in
Pontum invecta sint, usque ad hanc diem integrum inviolatumque
servatum est. Hoc tertium, quod erat Syracusis, quod M. Marcel-
lus armatus et victor viderat, quod religioni concesserat, quod cives
atque incolae Syracusani colere, advenae non solum visere, verum
etiam venerari solebant, id C. Verres ex templo J ovis sustulit. Ut
saepius ad M. Marcellum revertar, judices, sic habetote, plures esse
a Syracusanis istius adventu deos quam victoria Marcelli homines
desideratos. Etenim ille requisisse etiam dicitur Archimedem
illum, summo ingenio hominem ac disciplina, quem quum audisset
interfectum, permoleste tulisse : iste omnia quae requisivit, non ut
conservaret, verum ut asportaret requisivit. J am illa quae leviora
videbuntur ideo praeteribo, quod mensas Delphicas e marmore,
crateras ex aere pulcherrimas, vim maximam vasorum Corinthio-

ita . . ut] There are various ways of
translating this form (see Pro Plancio, c.
2. Vol. iv.), but it can seldombe trans-
lated literally. It means here ‘ Flamininus
it is true took that statue out of its tem-
ple, but he placed it in the Capitol? See
c. 67, ‘ita tamen laudent,' &c.

cives atque incolae] “Qui cives non
sunt, incolae dicuntur,” P. Manutius. He
refers to Lib. 3. c. 40, “Quid Halicyen-
ses, quorum incolae decumas dant, ipsi
agros immunes habcnt.” See also Lib. 4.
c. 11, “itemque incolis vestris civibus Ro-
manis ;'’ that 15, Roman citizens resident
at Rhegium.

Archimedem] He was killed by a Ro-
man soldier, as it is said, at the capture of
Syracuse by Marcellus, Rc. 212 (Liv. xxv.
313 Plutarch, Marcellus, c. 19). Cicero
(Tusc. Disp. v. 23) tells us that he disco-
vered the tomb of the great geometrician,
when he was ‘quaestor ' in Sicily.

‘Quem quum audisset’ R3. The com-
mon reading is ‘eumque quum audisset
interfectum,’ of which Zumpt says, ‘satis
perspicua interpolatorum vestigia prodit.'
I suppose he means to say that the ‘ inter-
polatores ' tried to mend the passage 3 but
why, it is hard to say. The reading in the
text is preferable to the common reading.
Zumpt adda that Garatoni cites a similar
passage from Act. i. 9. He means the
passage ‘qui quamobrem,' on which there
is a note. 1 don't know why an ordinary
construction of the Latin language should
cause a difficulty, or require to be de-
fended. See Lib. 4. c. - 48, ‘quas sibi

quum . . . peragrasse,’ and the note;
also Pro Plancio, c. 38, ‘qui quoniam’
&Le-Delphicas] A Delphica was a slab of
niarble, resting on some support 3 some-

times used as an ‘ abacus: as Martial (xii.
66, ed. Schneidew.) shows :ff

“ Argentum atque aurum non simplex
Delphica portat.’'

So called, says Zumpt, from the resem-
blance to the ‘mensa,’ on which the Py-
thia sat when she delivered her oracles.
The passage of Pliny (H. N. xxxiv. c. 3) is:
“ ex aere factitavere et cortinas, tripodum
nomine Delphicas, quoniam donis maxime
Apollinis Delphici dicabantur? These
were of bronze, whatever the form might
be, and supported on legs. It seems how-
ever that Delphica was used among the
Romans to signify a marble table (Juv.
Sat. iii. 204; and the Scholiast). Proba-
bly some of them were tables made of dif-
ferent specimens of stone. Plutarch (Ti.
Gracch. c. 2) has the expression, δελφῖνας
ἀργυροῦς, which has been altered to δέλφι-
5⁰²3.zzssgpffitbg11‘ssffiffs‘} ιῗὲῗῗιέἱῗῷῑῖαἶῗ
Ι suppose that the editors who adopt the
correction δέλφικας, mean to give it the
sense of ‘ Delphicas' here 3 but it ought to
be δελφικᾶς ἆρ’γυρᾶς.

‘Crateras :' the form ‘cratera' is not
limited to the poets, as Zumpt shows.
Ernesti's proposal to write ‘ pulcherrimos ’
is therefore unnecessary.
