of three Leges Porciae, “Leges Porciae
quae tres sunt trium Porciorum.” It is
supposed that the last ‘lex ’ was one pro-
posed by P. Porcius Laeca, B.c. 197, of
whom there is extant a ‘denarius‚' with
the inscription, P . LAECA . Pnovoco.
Zumpt observes, that as there appears to
have been nothing about the ‘provocatio’
or appeal in the Porcia Lex, it is probable
that it was a ‘ lex ' proposed by M. Porcius
Cato, the censor, who, according to Festus,
made a speech ‘ pro scapulis? Festus
says, “Pro scapulis cum dicit Cato, signi-
ficat pro injuria verberum. Nam com-
plures leges erant' ln civ es rogatae, quibus
sanciebatur poena v:erberum his significat
prohibuisse multos suos cives in ea ora-
tione quae est contra M. Caelium? ” It is
the opinion of most crities that P. Porcius
Laeca proposed the ‘ lex,' and that M. Por-
cius Cato spoke in favour of it (suasit).
The ‘lex' seems to have given an appcal
to a Roman citizen in the provinces against
the governor, and Gavius accordingly is re-
presented as making his appeal, by declar-
ing that he was a Roman citizen (Meyer,
Orat. Rom. Fragm. p. 21, 2ud ed.).

There appears to have been only one
Lex Sempronia on this matter, a ‘lex ' of
C. Sempronius Gracchus, B-O. 123. Cicero
says (Pro Rabirio, c. 4): “C. Gracchus
legem tulit ne de capite civium Romano-
rum injussu vestro ιᾖιιάίωιιᾞίιιιικυ

reddita . . tribunicia] See Divin. c. 3.

reciderunt] “ recciderunt, Gellii cod. C
ex apparatu Hertzii'' (Iordan). ‘Recci-

derunt' is certainly a genuine form, like
‘ reppulerunt.'

consilio in medio testem] This is the
MSS. reading. There is no variation.
Zumpt cannot explain it, and is driven to
adopt Hotmann's conjecture, ‘consilium in
medio testimonio dimitteret. ’ Orelli and
Iordan follow Zumpt. Hotmann observes
that every body knows that the ‘praetor’
might dismiss the ‘consilium’ or ‘ju-
dices,'that'1s‚adjourn the court, when he
pleased. I suppose thata‘ praetor’ might
‘ consilium dimittere,' when he saw a rea-
son for it, but if he could do so, that is no
evidence that he did so here. The MSS.
reading makes Glabrio send away the wit-
ness, which I suppose that he could also
do. The difficulty is in the words ‘ consi-
lio in medio,’ which calmet mean when the
Judice: ‘ nii-si sunt in consilium. ' If the
reading is right, it me ans in the midst of
the protwdings, and I do not set th the
sitting of the court could not be cwilltd

‘scon iliu1n‚'as well as the bodJ of‘ judicesss

who uere certainlJ so called from sitting
tog ether. Manutius explains ‘consilio in
medio' bJ say mg ‘j11dic‚'um and if 1 un-
derstand him, he means th ·1t‘ the Praetor
in the midst of the Consilium of the
J udices sent away the witness,’ to prevent
any popular outbreak and to remove all
blame on this head from himself and the
‘cons-ilium! whatever the true. explana-
tion may be, I prefer a text, which is sup-
ported by all the evidence, to a conjecture
for which there is none.
