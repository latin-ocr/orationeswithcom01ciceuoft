pacem fidelitatemque populi Syracusani sacra religiosaque acce-
pisset, omnes eas tabulas abstulit3 parietes quorum ornatus tot
saecula manserat, tot bella effugerat, nudos ac deformatos reliquit.
Et Marcellus, qui si Syracusas cepisset duo templa se Romae
dedicaturum voverat, id quod erat aedificaturus his rebus ornare
quas ceperat noluit: Verres, qui non Honori neque Virtuti, quem-
admodum ille, sed Veneri et Cupidini vota deberet, is Minervae
templum spoliare conatus est. Ille deos deorum spoliis ornare
noluit: hic ornamenta Minervae virginis in meretriciam domum
transtulit. Viginti et septem praeterea tabulas pulcherrime pictas
ex eadem aede sustulit, in quibus erant imagines Siciliae regum ac
tyrannorum, quae non solum pictorum artificio delectabant sed
etiam 'commemoratione hominum et cognitione formarum. Ac
videte quanto taetrior hic tyrannus Syracusanis fuerit quam quis-
quam superiorum; quia illi tamen ornarunt templa deorum immor-
talium, hic etiam illorum monumenta atque ornamenta sustulit.

manserat, . . eff'uyerass] All the good had many politieal revolution& and pro-
MSS. have ‘manserant . . . effugerant,' bably more kings and tyrauts than have

and of course ‘ornatus ’ must then be
taken for the plural.

voverat,] These temples of Honor and
Virtus, built by Marcellus, before the Porta
Capena, were adorned with the spoils of
Syracuse, as Livy (xxv. 40) says. Zumpt
observes, that he has not scen it remarked
that Cicero has made a mistake, in saying
that Marcellus made this vow during the
siege of Syracuse 3 for Livy (xxvii. 25) says
that he made this vow in his first consul-
ship, 13.c. 222, during the Gallie war, when
he was before Clastidium. But 1¹. Manu-
tius has remarked on this discrepancy be-
tween Cicero and Livy. Becker, Hand-
buch, i. p. 509, has collected the passages
which relate to these tempIeS, which stood
close together, but were separate build-

second m‘ember of the sentence: ‘ Verres,

clude that it ought to stand in the first
member also.

Syracuse; for Cicero seems to mean Syra-

‘cum illi . . ornarint? E Lg. 29 have
‘ ornarent‚’ and G 2 Ld. ‘ornaveruntss

illorum monumenta] ‘Illorum’ refers
to ‘ illi,' and is the reading of all the good
MSS. The common reading is ‘ deorum ’
(Zumpt).—“ sustulit libri meliores omnes
inde a Stephaniano vetere. '' (Zumpt). The
common reading is ‘ quum illi tamen orna-
rint—sustulerit.’ Klotz has ‘ quum illi
tamen ornarint . ., hic etiam deorum . .
sustulit.' 1 prefer the reading of Zumpt.
As to ‘ illorumss it is obviously the reading
which the sense requires. The tyr-ants
(illi) ornamented the temples of the goda
but Verres took away even the memorials
and dec-orations of the tyrants (illorum).
As to the remainder of the sentence, I am
not suro that Zumpt’s reading is better
than the common reading.

56. non viderint] G 1, Zumpt, ‘ vide-
runt ' R, ctt. Iordan has ‘ viderint! The
common reading is ‘ viderunt.' Zumpt
observes, that as it is not certain persons,
who had not seen these things, but all per-
sons arc meant who had not seen them, he
considers the subjunctive to be necessary.
