collocare. Quod commodum non mediocre rei publicae est, tantum
civium [Romanorum] numerum tam prope ab domo, tam bonis
fructuosisque rebus detineri. Et quoniam quasi quaedam praedia
populi Romani sunt vectigalia nostra atque provinciae, quemad-
modum vos propinquis vestris praediis maxime delectamini, sic
populo Romano jucunda suburbanitas est hujusce provinciae. J am
vero hominum ipsorum, judices, ea patientia, virtus, frugalitasque y
est ut proxime ad nostram disciplinam illam veterem, non ad hanc
quae nunc increbuit, 'videantur accedere. Nihil ceterorum simile ’
Graecorum: nulla desidia, nulla luxuries; contra summus labor in
publicis privatisque rebus, summa parsimonia, summa diligentia.
Sic porro nostros homines diligunt ut his solis neque publicanus
neque negotiator odio sit. Magistratuum autem nostrorum injurias
ita multorum tulerunt ut nunquam ante hoc tempus ad aram legum
praesidiumque vestrum publico consilio confugerint: tametsi et

usual place of residence. The first part of
the word is ‘domi ς’ the second part, if
the orthography is correct, contains the
same root as ‘concilimn.' If ‘ consilium'
contains the root ‘sed,' ‘ to sit,' which is
probable, we might conjecture that ‘ domi-

the letter ‘r’ is preserved, though it is
true that there are not two ‘ r's’ in these
verbs, as ‘ pigrescere,' διο. He adds, how-
ever, that the double ‘r' is not so in-
tolerable, for we have ‘ cribrum ³ and ‘ cri-
brare.'

silium' might be the correct form, which
would correspond to ‘ exsilium! The term
occurs in the Lex Plautia, Rc. 89 (Cic.
Pro Archia, c. 4), in the sense of a man’s
fixed residence (sedem omnium rerum ac
fortunarum suarum). It was important
for many purposes to determine where a
man’s ‘ domicilium ³ was ς for instance, if a
man was bound to pay a sum of money in
Italy, and his ‘ domicilium' was in a pro-
vince, he might be sued either in Italy or
in the ‘ provineia' (Dig. 5. 1. 19. § 4). In
the Digest (50. 1. 27. ξ 1) there is a de-
finition of ‘doniiciliuni.' In modern law
‘ domicile' is a title of law of some extent
and importance, and some of the principles
of this title of law are founded 011 the
Roman rules.

rebus detineri] Klotz has ‘ rebus deti-
nere‚' merely a blimder of some of those
MSS. which are generally good.

inm-eham] It appears from a note of
Zumpt (Divin. c. 4), that the authority of
the MSS. is rather in favour of ‘ incre-
brescere! He observes that a comparison
with ‘ emb-escere ’ does not help ns in this
matter, for the root is ⁴ rub,’ as in ‘ rubere?
His argument is, that ‘ erub-escere' is de-
rived from the verb ‘ rubere ς’ but that in
the verbs in ‘esce1·c,' from the adjectives
‘ aeger,’ ‘misen' ‘piger‚’ ‘scabcr‚’ ‘ taeter‚’

The notion of some of these verbs in
‘ escere ³ being formed from adjectives, and
others, as ‘erubescere' from a verb ‘ru-
bere‚' is a false etymological view. There
might be ‘ rubr-escere' as well as ‘rub-
escere‚' but the reason why there is not is
obvious enough. ‘ Rub’ begins with an
‘ r,’ and ‘ rubrescere ' would be as disagree-
able to the ear as ‘increbrescere' If the
Romans did not say ‘rubrescere‚' for the
same reason they did not say ‘ incre-
brescere? ‘ Cribrum' is nothing to the
purpose, for if the second ‘ r ³ was left out
we should have an adjective of a neuter
form, ‘ cri-bum,' which would be no word
at all. ‘Cribrare’ may be allowed to
Zumpt to support his argument, but he
might have added that the diminutive of
‘ cribrum ³ is ‘ em'bellum,' not ‘ cribrellum?
It may be added, that in ‘ereb-er' the
root lies in the part which Ι have sepa-
rated from the termination, and the word
may be, as Professor Key suggests, another
form of ‘celeb-er.' (See Lib. 2. c. 66,
note.) Nothing therefore of the root is
lost by writing ‘ in-ereb-uit.'

aram Ieaum] Hotmann refers to the
passage in Aristotle, Rhet. iii. 11 : ταύτὸν
εἶναι διαιτητὴν καὶ βωμὸν, ἐπ’ ἄμφω ’γὰρ
τὸ ἀδικούμενον φεύγειν.
