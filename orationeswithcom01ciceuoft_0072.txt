54 J UDIOIA.

justice and the laxity of no legal rule. Their law existed less in the
written text than in the understanding of the people‚ the true deposi-
tory of a large part of law, and that mainly which relates to the multi-
farious concerns of life which corne under the legal denomination of
Contracts, or the popular and wider term of Agreements.

It has been observed that the Leges Judiciariae did not relate to civil
actions, but to Criminal procedure. We cannot suppose that the
Senators who originally were the Judices in the Publica ‚Iudicia were ex-
cluded from being Judices in civil actions. Polybius (vi. 17) says that from'
the body of the Senate were appointedjudges (κριταί) of most both public
and private matters (συναλλαγμάτων), which involved any magnitude of
charge (ἐγκλημάτων) ; a statement too vague to build any thing upon. It
is at least certain that the Leges Judiciariae had nothing to do with civil
cases or actions. Besides these it would be absurd to suppose that the
Senatorian body would have maintained such a vigorous contest about
the J udicia in order to maintain their right to aet as J udices in matters
that concerned the ordinary transactions of a Roman plebeian, such as
buying and selling, pledgfflg, and the like. Augustus certainly, or perhaps
Caesar, extended the institution of the J udices Selecti to the J udicia
Privata; and the Judices for these matters also were from that time
taken from the Album Judicum Selectorum. This arrangement made
the Officium J udicis a duty incumbent upon all who were included in
the Album. It was not simply a distinction : it was also a. burden ; yet
of course the office would be viewed by the citizens generally as honour-
able (1 Hor. Sat. iv. 123).

Though so many offences against the State were brought under the
cognizance of the Quaestiones Perpetuae, the J udicia Populi, or trials
before the Comitia, still existed in Cicero’s time for the offence of Per-
duellio (Populus Romanus judicabit, &c In Verr. Act. ii. Lib. 5.
c. 69). If Verres should escape the prosecution for Repetundae, and
prosecutions for other offences also before the permanent courts, Cicero
threatens to bring him before the Populus Romanus, before the thirty-
five Tribes (Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 5). ln Cicero's consulship, B.c. 63, O.
Rabirius was prosecuted for Perduelli03 and when C. Julius Caesar and
L. Julius Caesar were appointed Duumviri Perduellionis by the Praetor
instead of by the Populus, Rabirium on being condemned, appealed to
the Populus in the Comitia Centuriam, and Cicero made a speech in his
defenee, part of which is extant. An instance of an appeal of this kind
is in the story of M. Horatius in Livy (i. 26).

The object of these remarks was to explain the nature of the court
before which Verres was tried; but it seemed also necessary to show that
the J udices Privati were distinct from the J udices in the Quaestiones
Perpetuae. There are several matters relating to the Publica J udicia.
