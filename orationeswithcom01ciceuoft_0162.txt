144 IN G. VERREM

fortunae sed etiam ingenuitatis? Miramur ad arma contra istum
hominem Lampsacenos isse? miramur istum de provincia deceden-
tem clam Syracusis profugisse? N os si alienam vicem pro nostra
injuria doleremus, vestigium istius in foro non esset relictum.
Pater dat filiae; prohibes: leges sinunt3 tamen te interponis.
De suis bonis ita dat ut ab jure non abeat. Quid habes quod
reprehendas? nihil, opinor. At ego concedo: prohibe si potes3
si habes qui te audiat3 si potest tibi dicto audiens esse quisquam(
Eripias tu voluntatem mortuis, bona vivis, jus omnibus? Hoc
populus Romanus non manu vindicasset, nisi te huic tempori atque
huic judicio reservasset ⁴?

Posteaquam jus praetorium constitutum est, semper hoc jure usi
sumus: si tabulae testamenti non proferrentur, tum, uti quemque
potissimum heredem esse oporteret, si is intestatus mortuus esset,
ita secundum eum possessio daretur. Quare hoc sit aequissimum
facile est dicere; sed in re tam usitata satis est ostendere omnes
antea jus ita dixisse, et hoc vetus edictum translatitiumque esse.

simul, dum est unde jus civile discatur, adolescentes ei in disci-

pro nostra effe] ‘if we had grieved for
another's lot, as if the wrong had been done
to ourselves.’ Zumpt compares Cic. Pro
Rosc. Am. c. 21, ‘pro summa solitudine?
Posteaquam jus praetorium] See Ex-
cursus iv. 011 the Edicta Magistratuum.
The division into chapters is sometimes
made in such a way as to obscure the argu-
ment. The matter of Annius, the Voconia
Lex, concludes with the indignant words,
‘huic judicio reservasset ;' and the words
‘Posteaquam jus praetorium,' &c., intro-
duce the case of Minucius, as to which
Cicero briefly states the law first, and then
shows how Verres behaved in this matter.
This is the remark of Madvig, Opuscula,
p. 348, “De locis aliquot Ciceronis Ora-
tionum Vcrrinarum dissertatio critica.''
possessio claretum] It was part of the
praetor-'s office to grant a ‘bonorum pos-1
sessio,' or permission to take possession of
the property of a deceased person in many
cases, which are mentioned further on, in
the notes to this chapter. The case here
put is that of the praetor granting a
⁶ bonorum possessio ' when no will was pro· ι
(luced, though there might bc a will, which
for some reason was not produced. In
such case, he could, as Cicero says, grant
a ‘ bonoriun possessio ’ to those who would
be ‘heredes' if the deceased had died in- *⁰

testate. But the praetor could not give
such persons a legal title ,· the utmost that
he could do was to protect them in the pos-
session which he had allowed them to take.
The words ‘si is intestatus mortuus esset '
are omitted by Orelli 'though they are in
the MSS„ and in all he old editions} in
conformity with the opinion of Hotnrann
that it is a gloss taken from Asconius.
Hotmann observes that there is nothing for
‘is ' to refer to; but this difficulty Zmnpt
removes, by understanding ‘ alicui ' with *
‘heredem esse.' But the true reading is
probably indicated by the words of the edict
quoted by Julian (Dig. 38. 7. 1), “tum
quem ei heredem esse oporteret, si intesta-
tus mortuus esset.” The text of Cicero
however may be explained as it stands.
The words ‘ tabulae testamenti> imply >
some person whose ‘ tabulae testamenti ’
were not produced. ‘ Is ³ therefore is ‘ the
person whose Tabulae were not produced?
‘ Secundum eum ³ means ‘in favour of him ς’
as in Act. ii. Lib. 2. c. 17, “de absente se-
cundum praesentem 1 udicare.” So ‘iindiciae
secundun] libertatem‚’ in favour of liberty
(Dig. 1. tit. 2. ς ei). ν
facile est [licere ,·] Orelli has ‘ docere?
45. aliud hominis] ‘hominis aliud ³ Ior-
dan, who also has ‘ in disciplinam ei.'
