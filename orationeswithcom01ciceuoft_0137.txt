AOT. Π. LIBER PRIMUS. 119

suis jam tum mali constitueretur, tamen ad istum venit3 ostendit
munus illud suum non esse3 se, quum suae partes essent hospitum

’ recipiendorum, tum ipsos tamen praetores et consules non legatorum
asseclas recipere solere. Iste qui una cupiditate raperetur totum
illius postulatum causamque neglexit: per vim ad eum qui recipere
non debebat Rubrium deduci imperavit.

XXVI. Hic Philodamus posteaquam jus suum obtinere non
potuit, ut humanitatem consuetudinemque suam retineret laborabat.
Homo qui semper hospitalissimus amicissimusque nostrorum homi-
num existimatus esset, noluit videri ipsum illum Rubrium invitus
[in] domum suam recepisse t magnifice et ornate, ut erat in primis
inter suos copiosus, convivium comparat : rogat Rubrium ut quos ei
commodum sit invitet, locum sibi soli si videatur relinquat: etiam
filium suum, lectissimum adolescentem, foras ad propinquum suum
quendam mittit ad cenam. Rubrius istius comites invitat: eos
omnes Verres certiores facit quid opus esset. Mature veniunt- ε
discumbitur. Fit sermo inter eos, et invitatio usGraeco more
biberetur. Hortatur hospes : poscunt majoribus poqulis : cele-
bratur omnium sermone laetitiaque convivium. Posteaquam

munus] ‘duty,' something of a public cups :³ ‘bibere' being supplied, as it is

nature which a man was bound to do.—
‘quum suae’ &c.: ‘when it was his turn
to receive strangers.'

asseclas] A shortened form of such a
word as ‘adsecula‚’ which contains the
crude form ‘sequu,' or ‘secu,' to follow.
For-cellini observes, that 111 501110 Mss. of
Cicero, thc reading in the I'ro Sestio, 0. 64,
is ‘ assecula!

26. jus suum affra] ‘could not maintain
his right.’

quos . . . commodum] ‘ whom 110 plcascd.'
See Lib. 5. c. 5.

invilalio ut Graeco more] Asconius ex-
plains this by saying that it was the Greek
fashion, when a man drank his wine, to
address the gods, and then his friends by
name. In the Tusculanae Disputationes
(i. 40) it is said that Theramenes, on drink-
ing the poison, thrcw what remained at the
bottom out of the cup, so as to make a
noise on the floor, wc may suppose, and
said: “ Propino hoc pulcro Critiae, qui in
cum fuerat tetcrrinms: (ἧι-0001011110 in con-
viviis solent nominare cui poculum tradituri
sint.” Zumpt explains ‘ Graeco more ’ to
be the ‘propinandi mos,’ 01 the custom of
addressing thc person to whom ⁸you wis-h
well, and otii-ring him a glass to empty,
after having first put it to your lips.

poscunt majoribus] ‘ they 01111 sor lai-ger

generally explained. In Lib. 3. c. 44, there
is ‘ quum maximis poculis . . ministraretur?
The expression seems to bc elliptical‚ a
phrase of ordinary conversation, in which
part is omitted of what ought to bc said.
In Horace (Carm. i. 4) wc have in some
texts

“ Seu poscat agna sive malit haedo,''

which is to be understood by referring to
the previous verse. Asconius says. “sunt
qui producta scilicet () litera poscunt le—
gunt‚ quasi saepe potant ;'' though he does
not adopt this interpretation, and it is not
likely that any one else will. There does
not appear to he a verb ‘po-scerc,’ con-
taining the root ‘po,’ ‘ to drink,’ though
it is a possible form, and there is the noun
‘ po-sca,' which may bc compared with
‘ c(d)—sca.'

celebratur . . . convivium] Such sentences
as these, so diss'crent from our mode of ex-
pression, are instanccs of the extreme diffi-
culty of translating the Latin language.
The notion of ‘ celebrare ’ is to ‘ fin: as in
Cicero, l)e l'rov. Cous. c. 9, “ cujus literis,
(1·οἿ celebrantur aures quotidie meac noris
nominibus gentium ;'’ ⁸· domus nostra cele-
bratur‚'' l'ro Murena, c. 34. The meaning
here is: ‘ all the ξ(11105111 were talking and
enjoying themselvch
