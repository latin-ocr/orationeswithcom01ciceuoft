(Ascon.) See Pro S. Rosc. Amerino, e. 30,
and the note.

tribuni militares] Thosc chief officers
of a legion, ‘tribuni militum‚' or ‘mili-
tares‚' who were elected by the people,
were called, says Asconius, ‘ Comitiati ;'
and those who were appointed in the army
by the commander were called ‘Rufulif
The exact meaning of the word ‘ veteres ³
is not clear. Zumpt supposes that it
means ‘¹ exercitati, rerum judiciorumque
gnari.'’ Asconius says ‘graves et severi?
and perhaps he is right. ‘Veteres' may
have the sense of ‘antiquiss men of the
old time, of the old stamp (see Pro Sestio,
c. 3, note).

Subsortiemwr] ‘ Subsortiri ³ is the word
used to express the choosing of ‘judices’
to take the place of those who were chal-
lenged (rejecti), or became incapable of
aeting as ‘judices,' in consequence of hold-
ing a ‘magistratus.' See Act. ii. Lib. 1.
c. 19, 61 ; Pro Cluentio, c. 34.

seeundum] Here the meaning of the
word ‘ secundus' (sequundus) is clearly
shown, and in a passage which shortly after
follows, ‘ secundum quos,³ ‘after which 3’
from which notion of ‘ following' are de-
rived the various senses of ‘ secundum-¹

Cn. Pompeius] The games which Cn.
Pompeius had vowed, as Asconius says, if
he should conquer Sertorius. Sertorius
was now dead. The war in Spain ended in
B-C. 72. (Introd.)

deinde continuo] Then, ‘without any
interruption,’ for this is the meaning of
‘continuus' The ‘ Ludi Roma11i,' or ‘ Cir-
censes Magni,’ were celebrated in the Cir-
cus Maximus, between the lst and the
leth of September, it is said. From the
leth of August to the leth of Septem-
ber makes thirty-five dayS, which Cicero in
round numbers calls nearly forty.

excusando*Victoriana] These ‘ Ludi
Victoriae ⁹ were instituted by L. Cornelius
Sulla after his victory over the Samnites
(Vell. Paterc. ii. 27) ; and they began on
the 27 th of October. By talking, and
availing themselves of legal technieal
grounds for delay, they would push on the
matter to the end of October. ‘ Excusare’
and ‘excusatio’ are the terms for legal
grounds of excuse, which, 111 this instance,
mean legal causes of delay in answering.
In the Fragmenta Vaticana there is a long
chapter, ‘De Exeusatione,' the matter of
which, though not applicable to this case,
shows what the meaning of the term is.

plebeios] These games began on the 4th
and lasted to the 17t11 of November3 and
thus the year would be near an end.
