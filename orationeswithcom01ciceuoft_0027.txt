IN Q. OAECILIUM DIVINATIO. 9

gives some other reasons, one of which is founded on the statement that the J udices
were ‘ injurati,' not sworn ; which, if there is no other evidence than that of this Asco-
nius, we may doubt. Quintilian (Inst. Or. vii. 4. § 33) says that such ‘judicia ³ were
called ‘ Divinationes.' The term ‘ Divinatio ' is also explained in the same way by the
grammarian Gabius Bassus (Gellius, ii. 4) ε “ Divinatio judicium appellatur, quoniam
divinet quodammodo judex oportet quam sententiam sese ferre par sit :²³ the J udices
must guess, as Gellius explains the meaning of Bassus, because they had little to found
their judgment upon. The name ‘Divinatio' expressed the whole proceeding, the
result of which was the selection of an accuser3 audit was also used to signify the
speech made on the occasion by the opposing claimants. C. Julius Caesar, the
dictator, composed a ‘Divinatio' (Sueten. Julius Caesar, 0. 55).

The Actio Prima against Verres was delivered on the 5ch of August, A.U.c. 684, or
B.C. 70 (c. 10). A prosecutor, as already observed, had asked and obtained a period of
108 days in order to go to Achaea to collect materials for a prosecution (Act. ii. Lib. 1.
c. 11) 3 and though Cicero says that he never went to Achaea, we may perhaps con-
clude that Cicero could not eommence his attack until the 108 days had expired.
He himself had 110 days allowed for his journey to Sicily to collect evidence, and,
though he was back again at Rome before the expiration of the time, the accuser who
had only asked for 108 days had the priority over him, and Cicero must wait to see
whether he really meant to avail himself of this advantage. If these conclusions are
right, the period of 108 days reckoned back from the 5th of August will fix the time
of the delivery of the ‘ Divinatio ³ somewhere in the latter part of April of the un-
reformed Calendar.
