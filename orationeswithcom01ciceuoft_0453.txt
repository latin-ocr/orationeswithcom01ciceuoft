F ORMULA OOTAVIAN A. 435

metus causa ’ is expressed as follows by Ulpian (Dig. 4. 2. 14, ξ 15);
“ Si plures metum adhibuerint et unus fuerit conventus, siquidem
sponte rem ante sententiam restituerit, omnes liberati sunt. Sed etsi
id nou fecerit, sed ex sententia quadruplum restituerit, verius est etiam
sic perimi adversus ceteros quod metus causa actionem.’'

Finally, the Edict gave a man the opportunity of avoiding the
‘ quadruplum ’ by restitution (Dig. 4. 2. 14. § 1, ‘ Si quis non restituat,
in quadruplum in eum judicium pollicetur‚’ See). He had the power of
making restitution at any time before the sentence was pronounced.

The Formula Octaviana only related to the action of the party who
had been wronged: for Formula is only another name for Actio. If
the injured party was sued upon some promise obtained by ‘vis et
metus,’ or any cause of action, the foundation of which was in ‘ vis et
metus‚’ his defence or answer was by the ‘ metus exceptio‚' or the plea
of constraint. This ‘ exceptio ' was ‘in rem,’ that is, general, and con-
sequently it was an answer not only to the ‘heres ’ of the person who
had used the ‘ vis et metus,’ and to any person who had purchased from
him, but also to any third person (‘ enimvero metus causa exceptio in rein
scripta est: Si in ea re nihil metus causa factum est3 ut non inspi-
ciamus an is qui agit metus eausa fecerit aliquid sed an omnino metus
eausa factum sit in hac re a quocunque, non tantum ab eo qui agit :’
Dig. 44. 4. 4. ἓ 33).

Ι have given as well as I can the substance of Rudorff’s essay in the
Zeitschrift fiir Geschichtliche Rechtswissenschaft (xii. 131); but it is
not easy to compress an essay of forty pages and to treat the matter
properly. If this is considered too technical an exposition, the fault is
with the subject, and it cannot be helped. These who will read with
care may understand it pretty well3 and they will see what paius the
Romans took to protect persons who had been eonstraiued by force or
threats to do any aet by which their pecuniary inti-rests were damaged,
or who had been by like means preventi-d from doing some act, the
omission of which was injurious to their interests. The ⁴ condictiones ’
of the Jus Civile applied to many eases3 and, among others, they enabled
a man to reeover what had been got from him by soree or threats3 and
Cicero alludes to this process in the Divinatio (c. 5), ‘ Civibus quum
sunt ereptae pecuniae,' Sao. But the ‘condictio’ could only be main-
tained against the original wrong-door (Dig. 12. 6. 49); and the thing
itself (a sum of money, sor instance), or the simple amount os the loss or
damage only could be recovered.

It was remarked that the Edict ran originally ‘ Quod vi metusque
eausa‚’ and that afterwards the word ‘vi’ was omitted, and properly
omitted. It is properly ‘ vis‚’ when the person to whom ‘ vis ’ is applied
is overpowered by physical force3 for instance, if money is taken from
