rum, ludorum, censendique causa.

Hujus J udicii et laudis fructum et

offensionis periculum vestrum; laborem sollicitudinemque nostram3
’ scientiam quid agatur memoriamque quid a quoque dictum sit,

omnium puto esse oportere.

Faciam hoc non novum sed ab iis qui

nunc principes nostrae civitatis sunt ante factum, ut testibus utar
statim: illud a me novum, judices, cognoscetiS, quod ita testes
constituam ut crimen totum explicem ; ubi id interrogando, argu-

sus, but the census was taken in the remoter
places at least, and the results were for-
warded to Rome. This is the opinion of
Mazocchi, no ‘great authority indeed, but it
seems probable enough (Mazocchi‚ Tab.
Herae. p. 455). They must have come
however to vote at the Comitia, and yet it
is impossible that any except the rich could
bear the expense and would take the
trouble of coming annually to the elections
from remote parts of Italy and staying
some time in Rome. But Ι know no evi-
dence that the votes were taken at the
place of a man’s residence and forwarded
to Rome.—‘ ludorum ³ is an emendation of
Manutius derived from the text of Asco-
nius. The MSS. have ‘iudiciormn.’ I do
not know why the people should come
‘judiciorum causa ς’ nor how we must ex-
plain the fact of all the MSS. having ‘ iudi-
ciorum,’ if Cicero wrote ‘ludoru1n.'

censendique causa] The verb ‘ censere '
is applied to the office of the consors in
making registers of the citizens and of their
property. It is also applied to the citizens
giving in their 111111105, the names of their
‘ familia? and the particulars of their pro-
perty, as in the oration Pro Flacco, c. 32,
“in qua tribu denique ista praedia 0011511-
isti ?” ‘Censcndi causa' here means for
the purpose of giving in the particulars
which were required. Sec l⁴¹orcellini.

scientiam quid afflatur 110] This rc-
scmblcs a Greek form of expression, so far
as this, that in Greek the noun sometimes
has the Same effect on the construction as
if it were a verb.

principes] Asconius says that Cicero
alludes to the prosecution of L. Cotta by
the brothers Μ. and L. Lucullus who “ non
usi sunt perpetua oratione, scd interroga-
tione testium causmn peregerunt ’¹ (comp.
Cicero, Dc Oll'. ii. 1·1‹; Acad. Pr. ii. at the
beginning). Zumpt thinks that Asconius
is mistaken as to Cotta being prosecuted,
and that we must follow the authority of
Plutarch (Lucullus, 1·. 1), who speaks of
thc prosccution of Servilius. But Plutarch
mentions only 0110 prosecutor, L. Lucullus,
in the case ot· Servilius. Asconius speaks

voL. 1.

of two prosecutors.

ut testibus utar statim :] ‘1 will exa-
mine my witnesses at once, from the very
commencement.’ It is easy to perceive
that the position of words in Latin sen-
tences is determined by their relative value
in the sentence, and that such a word as
‘ statim ' may stand as it does here, when
the orator terminates with it as the em-
phatic word. Thus in the De Am. c. 26
‘ eaque ipsa concludamus aliquando.’

ubi id interroganda] Klotz reads, ‘ ut
ubi id,' &c. Hotmann saw the difficulty of
this passage, but he has not removed it by
suggesting the transposition of ‘interro-
gando’ so that it shall stand between ‘ ut '
and ‘ crimen’ 'm the preceding line; for the
words ‘eadem interrogandi facuItaS, argu-
mentandi fficendique' at the end of the
sentence appear to correspond to ‘ interro-
gando, argumentis atque oratione! The
difficulty lies in the words ‘ tum testes ad
crimen accommodem? Cicero says, that
there will be something new in 1115 mode of
proceeding‚ which novelty will not cousist
in examining the witnesses from the first,
for this had been done before. The novelty
is this. ‘ I will 50 arrange my witnesses as
to unfold the nature of the charge in
general? He then 1111115, ⁴ and when by my
examinatimi, my arguments, and my 1115-
coursc, Ι have established it, I will then
apply my witnesses to the (particular)
chargess that of 6111-1101011110οἶ lle says
shortly afterwards, ‘Haec primae actionis,'
&cm ⁸ The charge in the first Actio will bc
as follows ;’ and then, after 51111101,Γ the
general charge against Verres, he adds,
‘ and besides 1 charge him with 1110141111),ν
carrying oll' from Sicily “ qumlringenties
sestertisuu.''' He seems, therefore, to say
that he will first establish the general cha-
racter of his misconduct (totum erinnem,
which he afterwards expresses by ‘multa
libidinose, multa 1·1·1111011101·,’ &eq and then
he will apply 1115 witnesses to the proof, {lue
‘crimem' which was lala-tundam or. 115
110 otherwise expresses it, “ 111111111111110111105
