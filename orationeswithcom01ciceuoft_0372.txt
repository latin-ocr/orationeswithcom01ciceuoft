reading. But Lg. 42 has ‘ratio.' Klotz technical signification ‘possident ³ here

translates his text thus : ‘ Ι 0311 be brief in
what I say about the Aetnenses ;' and adds,
it is only necessary to rightly understand
the genitive, which depends on ‘oratio.'
He compares Lib. 2. c. 69: “Eripiunt
tibi istam orationem contemnendorum Si-
culorum atque aratorum statuae illae
equestres,'’ which, of course, he would ex-
plain in the same way. Zumpt says of
the reading ‘ Sed mihi . . 01·atio,'——-“ quae
dicendi ratio vix Latina potest haberi,
Aetnensium pro de Aetnensibus.” Klotz
observes that a grammarian like Zumpt
should not have allowed such a remark to
escape him. Klotz may be right, and
Zumpt wrong, for what 1 know9 but I
should like to have seen other instances
produced besides the only one that Klotz
refers to in Lib. 2. 0. 69.

MSS. and the older editions have ‘re-
prehendendis’ The things opposed are
‘ committing theftj and ‘ detecting ;’ and
the word for detection is ‘ deprehendere?
Zumpt observes “ nam dicitur h. 1. 11011 de
corrigendo, scd dc inveniendo.”

partem possident ;] We cannot tell what

has ; whether these men were owners 01·
tenants. He means 10 say that the largest
part of the ‘Aetnensis ager' was culti-
vated by Centuripini. They were the
great farmers of Sicily, as this chapter
shows: ‘Arant enim tota Sicilia fere
Centuripini.' He adds, ‘ quod in omnium
fere finibus possessiones habent ς’ which
may mean that these enterprisiug agri-
eulturists held land as owners iu many
parts of Sicily. There is no difficulty
about giving ‘possessiones' this meaning
(0. 46). They certainly farmed as te-
nants, 0. 21. See the note on Commer—
cium, e. 40, and the reference to Becker.
Rudorff (Gromat. ii. 306) says that the
Centuripini had the capacity of owning
lauded property in all the other Sicilian
states, and that all these states had no
‘ commercium agrorum' among them, and
consequently the inhabitants of these seve-
ral states could only be tenant farmers in
the states to which they (lid not belong 3
and thus gradually the ownership of the
land must come into the hands of Centu-
ripini. He refers to iii. 40, 45, and to iv.
23, as evidence for his assertion. This is
one of the most monstrous perversions of
evidence that I have seen in a philological
