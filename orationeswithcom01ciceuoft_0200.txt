according to the J us Civile or strict Roman law, but he was owner so
far as concerned the justice of his claim. He might have done all that
was necessary to acquire the ownership of athing, except the observance
of some form which the J us Civile required; and the Praetor might
direct the Judex, if he found the facts of the case to be such as stated
in the formula, to consider him as owner and decide accordingly, just as
if the person had acquired the thing in such a way as would have made
him owner by the J us Civile ⁵. This mode oftreating a given case, as if
it were in all respects conformable to another case, to which certain
rules of law are applicable‚ is what the Romans call Fictio. Some
modern writers who have made themselves merry over legal fictions
have been more merry than wise. A legal Fiction may be a bad figment
or a good one. When it is a good one, it accomplishes its object: it
satisfies a want and a necessity. He who by virtue of his office is able
to become the interpreter of the common understanding of the people‚
takes from the people‚ whose activity is the real generator of law, a
material to which his skill gives the proper form and his office the due
authority. He legislates in a sense, and he is generally a better legis-
lator than a large body of men called a Legislature. How long a Fiction
should be allowed to subsist after it has indicated a social want, and
shown how it is to be supplied, is a different question. The direct
mode of supplying such a want is by legislation, by the act of a sove-
reign person, or of a number of persons possessed of sovereign power, or
who have power delegated to them for that purpose: this is properly
called Legislati0n‚ the establishment of new rules of law by Statutes, or
by Leges, as the Romans called them.

The Lex Aebutia also gave the Praetor the power of assisting a
defendant by means of the formula. The simplest defence is a denia]
of a plaintiff's claim, who must then prove it. But the claim of the
plaintiff in itself may be undeniable, and yet there may be some fact
which is sufficient to nullify it. The Praetor in his formula could
instruct the J udex to decide in favour of the defendant, not only if the
claim of the plaintiff could not be established, but also if the fact or
facts, which the defendant alleged as a sufficient answer to the plaintiff's
demand, should be established by him. This fact, or these facts, which
are an answer to a demand, which otherwise would be a valid demand,
are an Exceptio, an answer or plea: and this Exceptio protected the
defendant against a demand which was valid by the J us Civile, when-
ever the Praetor thought fit to give the Exceptio this effect. Here also
the Praetor did not act arbitrarily. He would only allow an Exceptio
when common opinion had already pronounced in some way that it
