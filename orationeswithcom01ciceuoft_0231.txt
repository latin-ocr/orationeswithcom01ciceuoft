fundum, nemo bona patria obtinere, si, quum haec a quopiam ves-
trum petita sint, praetor improbus, cui nemo intercedere possit, det
quem velit judicem, judex nequam et levis quod praetor jusserit

Si vero illud quoque accedet ut in ea verba praetor judi-

by Zumpt, without any observation, though
they are in Orelli, Klotz, and I suppose in
all the old editions, and in the MSS. The
omission seems to be an error of the press,
which error occurs in the English reprint
of Zumpt's edition. ‘ Obtincre ' means ‘ to
maintain his title t0.'

nemo intercedere] “ In provincia sci-
licet ; nam Romae appellari tribuni pos-
sunt contra omnem potestatem.” This· is
a sample of the better part of the Asco-
nian connnentary. Compare Cic-em, Ad
Q. Fr. i. 1. 0. 7, where he says of the pro-
vince of Asia, “ubi nullum auxilium (no
appeal to the tribunes), nulla conquestio,
nullus Senatus, nulla contio.’' In a pro-
vince the governor was not 011001(οᾶ by
any ‘intercessio' of a ⁵ tribunu& 01· of any
‘ magistratus' of equal rank with himself
or greater.

L. Balbus judeoe,] He was one of the
‘jluliceS,’ and Cicero ingeniously pays him
a compliment for his legal knowledge and
his integrity3 and yet even Balbus, if he
had been a ‘judex ' appointed by Verres,
could not have (10110 otherwise than follow
the directions contained in um praetor's
formula. The words ‘Si paret' &e. are
taken from the Formulae, cxamples of
which we are now better aequainted with
from Gaius3 and 500 Lib. 1. 0. 15 and the
note: but Savigny remarks that Gaius
(iv. ξ 39—41) (1005 not reekon as partos
the Formula the words whieh always stand
at the beginning, as for example, ‘ L. Oe-
tavius judex esto? The Formula, 115 it ἱ5
1101·0 supposed by Cicero, is eorreet in ex-
pression, but unjust in the substance.
Klotz supposes thc Formula to have been
pcrverted by Cicero, but the orator merely
gives it as an example of what Verres did
or might havc done, and what a ‘judex '
must obey. If, says the Fornmla, it ap·
pears that the land belongs to Servilius,
and 110 does not give it up to Catulus, who
was not thc owner, then the ‘judex ' must
compel him to do 50, 01· mulet him in
dmnageS. This is absurd enough, and
palpablc injustiee ; but it is what Cicero
represents Verres 115 doing. l'uehta 5011-
poses (lust. ii. ξ 166) that Catulus was the
attoruey (procurator) of Servilius ; and in
such a case, though the ‘ intentio’ or (10-

mand is made in the name of the plaintiff,
the ‘ condemnatio' is expressed in favour
of the attorney or agent, as in the example
in Gaius (iv. 86) x “ Qui autem alieno no-
mine agit, intentionem quidem ex persona
domini sumit, condemnationem autem in
suam personam convertit: nam si verbi
gratia Lucius Titius (pro) Publio Maevio
agat, ita formula coneipitur: Si paret N.
N. Publio Maevio sestertium X milia dare
oportere, judex N. N. Lucio Titio sester-
tium X milia condemna ,· si non paret, ab-
solve. In rem quoque si agat, intendit
Publii Maevii rem esse ex jure Quiritium
et condemnationem in suam personam con-
vertit.'' Puchta observes that Cicero 00111-
plains of this Formula of Verres as of 501110-
thing unusual, though there is no doubt
that it was of daily application in the 01150
of ‘procuratores' He adds however that
Cicero means only its application by a
uieked praetor like Verres. But this ex-
planation is quite inconsistent with what
follows: ‘non 11000550 erit,' ἂψ, where
Cicero says that the ‘judex ’ must eompel
Servilius, the owner, to give up ‘the land
to Catulus. It is singular that most per-
sons have missod the sense of the passage.
Cicero takes the 115001 formula, and shows
how Verres applied it in the most extra-
vagaut and absurd way; or rather, he
5011110505 11 ease 115 extraragant 115 the one
which he puts, a ease which we must not
suppose to be a real ‹·ase; bnt lle adds,
even a Balbus must have followed the
praetor-'s order. And this extravagant in-
stam-0 is made a kind of sample of the
proeeedings of Verres in Sieilyz ‘Ejus-
demmodi totum jus praetorium ' ac.

On this formula Savigny remarks (Sys-
tem, &eq v. 30, note (e) ) ε “ Cieero mani-
festly here seleets an established, generally
known Fmanula, and what he remarks
thereupon as a erying pieee of injustia·
eonsists simply in this, that, aeeording to
this mode of drawing up the Fornmla, the
restitution of the land (fmulos) must 110
made to another person than the one
already designated 115 owner.” Catulus is
the plaintill', Servilius is the owner; and,
if the property is proved to belong to Ser-
vilius, he must be compelled to give it up
to Catulum This explanation by Voorda
