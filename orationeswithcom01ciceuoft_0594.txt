576 1N O. VERREM

Et nunc cuiquam credo esse dubium quin tu id commissurus non
fueris, praesertim quum statuisses, ut ais, tibi causam csse dicen-
dam, ut ille archipirata non potius securi feriretur, quam, quod erat
ante oculos positum, tuo periculo viveret—Si enim esset mortuus,
tu qui crimen ais te metuisse, quaero, cui probares? quum con-
staret istum Syracusis a nullo visum esse archipiratam, ab omnibus
desideratum; quum dubitaret nemo quin abs te pecunia liberatus
esset; quum vulgo loquerentur suppositum in ejus locum quem pro
illo probare velles'3 quum tu te fassus esses id crimen tanto ante
metuisse3 si eum diceres esse mortuum, quis te audiret? Nunc
quum vivum nescio quem istum producis, tamen te derideri vides:
quid, si aufugisset, si vincla rupisset ita ut Nico ille, nobilissimus
pirata, fecit, quem P. Servilius, qua felicitate ceperat, eadem recu-
peravit, quid diceres P——Verum 1100 erat : si ille semel verus pirata
securi percussus esset, pecuniam illam non haberes: si hic falsus
esset mortuus aut profugisset, 11011 esset difficile alium in suppositi
locum supponere. Plura dixi quam volui de illo archipirata, et
tamen ea quae certissima sunt hujus criminis argumenta praeter-
misi. Volo enim esse totum mihi crimen hoc integrum. Est
certus locus, certa lex, certum tribunal, quo 1100 reservetur.

Et nunc cuiquam effe] This is the tamen te derideri vides-s] This is the

reading of R 3 λ. The common reading is
‘ Et 11011 credo esse dubium? ‘ Credo ' ge-
nerally stands alone in this form of expres-
sion, as in Lib. 1. c. 24, ‘At‚ credo, in
hisce solis rebus 3³ but it may be joined
with the infinitive also. Manutius, who
read ‘Est nunc, credo, cuiquam dubium‚'
calls this ‘implicata sententia3' but he
saw the meaning, which 15, ‘you would
not have kept this archpirate in your
house with so much danger before your
eyes (quod erat ante oculos positum) :’ the
danger was a trial for ‘ majestas,’ which is
again mentioned at the end of this chapter.
But the sentence is incomplete: ‘you
would not have run this risk unless you
had got something by it.' He has not
however pointed out the real connexion
of the parts of this confused passage.
Cicero, after ‘ tuo periculo viveret‚' instead
of finishing his sentence, passes to the
supposed case of the man having died
while he was in the custody of ⁴Verres,
or having escaped, and to the con-
sequence of such a contingency; and he
resumes ‘ Verum hoc erat,’ ‘but the real
truth is this: which must be connected
with the sentence that ends with ‘tuo
periculo viveret.’

reading of all the MSS. except G 1, which
has ‘tantum’ for ‘tamen 3’ and Zumpt
adopts ‘tantumj in which 110 15 followed
by Orelli. But ‘tamem’ as Madvig ex-
plains it, appears to be the true reading:
‘Now when you do produce alive some
prisoner or other of yours, still you see
that you are ridiculed ;' that is, nobody
believes. ‘ What would you have said if
he had escapedP’ This is all consistent
and clear. Zumpt explains ‘ tantum ' thus :
“ nunc nihil aliud nisi derideris, sed si au-
fugisset ille et ad socios redisset, gravis-
simam culpam subires.”

conjectura inventus est, codd. (etiam coll.
Havn.) in eo ’' (Zumpt).

crimen hoc integrum] See Lib. 1. 0. 5.
Zumpt thinks that Cicero would have
failed in this ‘ majestatis judieio,’ unless he
could have produced some better proof of
the archpirate being released for a sum of
money3 for all that is proved is, that Verres
kept him at his house after he left the pro-
vince. Would not that be enough? He
ought to have executed him. Besides,
Cicero does not admit that this was the
real man. Verres would have to prove
that. He was bound to show what became
