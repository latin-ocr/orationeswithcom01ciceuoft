DIVINATIO. 35

erat cuiquam dubium quin illa dixisset. Iste in possessionem bono-
rum mulieris mittit ; ipsam Veneri in servitutem adjudicat ; deinde
bona vendit3 pecuniam redigit. Ita dum pauca mancipia Veneris
nomine Agonis ac religione retinere vult, fortunas omnes libertatem-
que suam istius injuria perdidit. Lilybaeum Verres venit postea;
rem cognoscit; factum improbat ; cogit quaestorem suum pecuniam
quam ex Agonidis bonis redegisset, eam mulieri omnem adnumerare
et reddere. Est adhuc, id quod vos omnes admirari video, non
Verres sed Q. Mucius. Quid enim facere potuit elegantius ad ho-
minum existimationem, aequius ad levandam mulieris calamitatem,
vehementius ad quaestoris libidinem coercendam? Summe haec
omnia mihi videntur esse laudanda. Sed [repente] e vestigio ex
homine tamquam aliquo Circaeo poculo factus est Verres. Redit
ad se atque ad mores suos. Nam ex illa pecunia magnam partem

ad se vertit3 mulieri reddidit quantulum visum est.

and more than is worth repeating. The
reader may consult Puchta‚ Instt‘t.; and,
for various references as to ‘ recuperatores,'
Rein, Das Rb'miselce Privatreelzl, p. 420, ·
and Klotz, in his notes on Cicero, Pro
Caecina, vol. i. p. 464, who appears to
have collected nearly all that ean be said.
Consistently with the etymology of the
word, ‘ recuperatores‚’ οι· ‘reciperatores'
(recovercrs)‚ were employed in cases where
a fact easy to be established was the only
matter in question, or where a very speedy
decision was required, as in the ‘ luter-
dictum de vi hominibus armatis? aud in the
‘Actio Injuriaruni ’ (Gellius, xx. 1). The
mode of proceeding before them was the
sanie as before a ‘judex.'

mistim] This is the usual word in such
a case. Iordan following G 1 Ld D has
‘ intrat.’ G 2 has ‘intrat vel mittit: one
of which words is a gloss, The dtt have
‘mittin' and in this instance the worse
are the better.

pecuniam redigit. ] This term is applied
to getting in inone3, as ιι1ι(ιι ιι ιιιιιιιι got in
all his (lebts, and to converting proper't3
into inone3 by sale (Liv3, v. c. 16; Η(ι1·.
Epod. 2. 69). Caecilius pi ο((((1((1 liarshly

and adjudicating her to Venus. As to her

Q. fllaciam] This is Q. Mucius Scae-

another allusion to Q. Mucius, Act. ii. Lib.
