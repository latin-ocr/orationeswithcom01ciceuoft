AoT. II. LIBER SECUNDUS. 201

quando id quod imperaretur recusavit? Itaque ille M. Cato
Sapiens cellam penariam rei publicae nostrae, nutricem plebis
Romanae, Siciliam nominabat. Nos vero experti sumus Italico
maximo difficillimoque bello Siciliam nobis non pro penaria cella,
sed pro aerario illo majorum vetere ac referto fuisse: nam sine
ullo sumptu nostro coriis, tunicis, frumentoque suppeditando
maximos exercitus nostros vestivit, aluit, armavit.

III. Quid illa, quae forsitan ne sentiamus quidem, judices, quanta
sunt l quod multis locupletioribus civibus utimur, quod habent pro-
pinquam, fidelem, fructuosamque provinciam, quo facile excurrant,
ubi libenter negotium gerant3 quos illa partim mercibus suppedi-
tandis cum quaestu compendioque dimittit, partim retinet ut arare,
ut pascere, ut negotiari libeat, ut denique sedes ac domicilium

strengthens the expression. ‘ Ultro ³ means
towards some point from the subject of
the discoursc, which point or direction is
indicated by the context (see Ovid, Met.
iii. 457) 3 consequently it sometimes means
‘authen' ‘in addition ς’ and it may be
translated here ‘ did she not even profi'er ?'

Sapiens] See Divin. c. 15.

cellam penariam] ‘ Cella' has the
form of a diminutive, like ‘ sella,’ and
it may be one. It means a store-place.
There was the ‘ cella penaria' for the
‘penuS,' or year’s stock of useful things3
the ‘ cella olearia,' ‘vinaria‚’ and so forth
(De Seu. c. 16). The word ‘penus’ was
sometimes the matter of a legacy, and
therefore it was necessary for the meaning
of it to be fixed. There is a title in the
Digest (33. tit. 9), ‘ De Penu Legata,’ in
which (S. 3) the various opinions of the
Roman lawyers on the meaning of a legacy
of‘penus' arc given. The terni eompre-
hends more than things for cating and
drinking. See also Gellius, iv. c. 1.
Strabo (p. 273, ed. Cas.) says of Sicily:
καὶ δὴ καὶ καλοῦσιν αὐτὴν ταμεῖον τῆς
Ῥώμης. Compare also Livy xxvi. 32.

We sec what is meant by Sicily being a
‘cella penaria’ for Rome. The Romans
furnished themselves well at the expense
of the eultivators of this fertile island,
who gave because they could not help
giving. In the Italic or Social &Var (irc.
90), vvc are told that it furnished supplies
to the Roman army free of coshssa cir-
cumstance which must hare greatly as-
sisted Rome in that terrible struggle for
the supremacy in Italy. See Polybius (vi.
39) on the mode of supplying the Roman
armies.

In place of ‘coriis‚' Servius (Ad Aen. i.

5), who quotes the passage, reads ‘ copiis ;'
at least so it is in the text of Masw'cius.
But ‘coriis' is the right reading. Pre-
pared skins were used for tents, shields,
and other military purposes (Caesar, B. G.
iii. 293 Liv. v. 2; Tacit. Ann. iv. 72, xiii.
35).-The common reading is ‘ frumen-
toque suppeditato,' which Orelli, Klotz,
and Iordan have. ‘ Suppeditando' is the
reading of Lg. 42 p. m. Either reading is
Latin.

aerario] See the note on ‘ fiscos? Aet.
i. c. 8. The Roman ‘aerarium' was an
artificial person. Livy (xxvi. 32) speaks
of Syracuse as ‘ horreum atque aerarium
Populi Romani.’ Cicero says with inore
exactness ‘pro aerario) There were three
‘aeraria‚' or rather three names sor the
same thing, the names having relbrence to
particular appropriations. The ordinary
‘ aicrarinm' received the ordinary taxes
and supplied the ordinary expenditur-e.
The ‘ aerarium sanctius' was supplied
from the ‘ vicesima: and was called ‘ sanc—
tius-x because it was only resorted to in
the greatest need (Liv. xxvii. 10). The
third, or Gallicum, was appropriated sor a
Gallie war, in ease there should be one.
The Romans had always before their eyes.
the dangers of a Gallie invasion. For
more than two thousand years Rome has
never been safe against the Gaul. l’. Ma-
nutius (Connncntary on Cicero, Ad Aa.
vii. 15) makes this division into three
‘ aeraria 3’ others make only two.
