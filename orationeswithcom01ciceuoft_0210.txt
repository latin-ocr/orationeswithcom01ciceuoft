192 JUs GENTIUM.

“ Quod naturalis ratio inter omncs homines constituit, id apud omnes
populos peraeque custoditur vocaturque J us Gentium '' (Gaius i. 1).

Mr. Austin (An Outline of a Course of Lectures on General Juris-
prudence) says, “ The J us Gentium of the earlier Roman lawyers, Ι shall
distinguish from the Jus Naturale 01· Jus Gentium, which makes so
conspicuous a figure in the van of the Institutes and Pandects. Ι shall
show that the Jus Gentium of the earlier Roman lawyers is peculiar to*
the Roman Law3 whilst the latter is equivalent to the Law of Nature,
as the terms are commonly understood by modern writers upon juris-
prudence. I shall show that the Jus Gentium of the earlier Roman
lawyers was a purely practical notion: that it arose from the peculiar
relations borne by the Urbs Roma to her dependent allies and subject
provinces. I shall show that the latter is a purely speculative notion:
that it was stolen by the jurists styled classical and by them imported
into the Roman Law, from certain muddy hypotheses of certain Greek
philosophers touching the measure or test of positive law and mo-
rality.”

The earliest of the extant classical jurists who speaks of ‘ jus naturale ’ is
Gaius, who wrote in the time of M. Aurelius, He makes two divisions
of Lavv (i. ξ 1) with respect to its origin, Jus Civile, the peculiar law of
any state, and J us Gentium, the law which prevails among all nations3
and this J us Gentium in his institutional treatise is equivalent to J us
Naturale (ii. 65. 73). This division is that which prevails among the
Roman law writers. Ulpian, who died in the reign of Alexander
Severus, in the first book of his Institutions makes a threefold division
of Law, into Jus Naturale, which is common to men and animals; Jus
Gentium, which is common to all peoples3 and Jus Civile, which is the
law of any particular people, as of the Romans. In the Institutions of
Justinian (i. tit. 1, 2) Ulpian’s threefold division is adopted, and his
definition of Jus Naturale is imported into the Institutiones. Imme-
diately after Ulpian's definition of J us Naturale Justinian’s compilers
have placed (i. tit. 2. ξ 1) the words of Gaius (i. ξ 1) which make a
twofold division of law3 and again the compilers in another passage (ii.
tit. 1. ξ 11) have used the words of Gaius, and have added that Jus
Naturale is the same as Jus Gentium (quarundam enim rerum do-
minium nanciscimur jure naturali, quod, sicut diximus, appellatur jus
gentium3 quarundam jure civili). Certainly the notions of these com-
pilers were very confused, and they did not see clearly what they were
doing.

Ulpian's natural law must certainly be excluded altogether from the
Roman system; and there remains only the twofold division of Graius, in
which J us Naturale and J us Gentium are equivalent, and founded on
