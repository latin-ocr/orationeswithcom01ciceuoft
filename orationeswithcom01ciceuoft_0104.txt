86 INTRODUOTION.

evidence enough on the real charges to ensure the condemnation of Verres.
Ι conclude that Cicero when he wrote the Actio Secunda wished to expose
the whole life of Verres, and also to give to these five rhetorical exer-
cises, as far as he could, the appearance of being real speeches. And 011
the whole he has succeeded well in producing this general impression,
and it is fortunate for us that we possess such an instructive and
amusing piece of writing as his Second Actio. But he has not written
this Second Actio with a strict observation of what he would have said,
if he had spoken these orations3 and the first book, which is ou the
Praetura Urbana and other extraneous matters, though valuable to us,
spoils the effect, which we suppose that Cicero intended to produce.
But we cannot doubt that so accomplished an advocate and writer knew
what he was doing. As the five books were written only to be read, we
may suppose that he was careless about confining himself strictly to his
case. His purpose was to show what a villain Verres was all through
his public life, and to let his readers see how he could deal with him.

[Those who have the inclination may read the Preface of the Pseudo-
Asconius to this oration (ed. Orelli, p. 154). It begins “Deinceps haec
omnia non dicta sed scripta sunt contra eum, quod [ita] factum est:
Fingit Cicero adesse in judicio Verrem comperendinatum, respondere
citatum et defendi.”]
