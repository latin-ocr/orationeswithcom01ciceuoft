442 IN O. VERREM

Recte admones: Polyclitum esse dicebant. Messanam ut quisque
nostrum venerat, haec visere solebat: omnibus haec ad visendum
patebant quotidie: domus erat non domino magis ornamento quam
civitati. O. Claudius, cuj us aedilitatem magnificentissimam scimus
fuisse, usus est hoe Cupidine tamdiu dum forum diis immortalibus
populoque Romano habuit ornatum : et quum esset hospes Heiorum,
Mamertini autem populi patronus, ut illis benignis usus est ad
commodandum, sic ipse diligens fuit ad reportandum. N uper¹
homines nobiles hujusmodi, judices, et quid dico‘nuper, immo vero
modo ac plane paulo ante vidimus, qui forum ac basilicas non

He gives an air of reality, or of a spoken
discourse, to that which was only written ;
as Demosthenes and other Athenian-s did,
for they wrote out and polis-hed their
speeches after the delivery, which does not
exclude the supposition of their being writ-
ten also before delivcry. Wolf (adv. Lep-
tin. 68) compares with this passage of
Cicero the following passage of Demos-
thenes: Λάβε δὴ καὶ τὸ Χαβρίᾳ ψήφισμα
ψηφισθέν. ὅρα δὴ καὶ σκόπει· δεῖ ’γὰρ
αὐτὸ ἐνταῦθα εἶναί που. 800 the note of
Wolf, who refers to Quintil. Inst. Or. ix.
2. 61. Pliny, the younger, in a letter to
Tacitus (i. 20), also quotes this passage:
“ideo in optima quaque mille figuras ex-
temporales invenimus: in his etiam quas
tantum editas scimus, ut in Verrem, Artifi-
cem, quem? quemnam ?'' ac.

Polycletus was either a native of Sicyon
or Argos. There is some difficulty about
the matter (Sillig, Catalogus). There were
at least two sculptors of the name. Cicero
may mean the elder and more illustrioris,
who was a great artist. His Doryphorus,
which appears to be the 5111110 as the Canon,
01· model statue, was the example which
Lysippus studied.

O. Claudius‚] Pulcher, Aedilis Cui-ulis,
13.C. 99, who, as Pliny says (H. N. viii. 7,
ed. Hard.), was the first who ornamented
the ‘ scena' with paintings. (800 Valerius
Max. ii. c. 4. 6.) This practice of deco-
rating the Forum is mentioned by Livy
(ix. 40), and he attempts to assign the
origin of the practice. See Lib. 1. c. 22.

Zumpt says that this is an oblique attack
on Hortensius, who made a magnificent
display in his aedileship (B.C. 7 5), but was
suspected of having received money and
presents for this purpose, from persons who
had been guilty of irregularitics like Verres
(De Off. ii. 16. Brut. c. 92).

basilicas] This is a Greek word, sig-
nifying a royal building of some sort. The

Basilicae of Rome were large buildings, de-
signed for public business, particularly mer-
cantile business. They were afterwards also
used, or part of them, as courts of justice.
A Basilica was a roofed building supported
by columns, so arranged as to form a por-
tico all round the interior of it. The ‘ tri-
bunal ³ was at one end of the building, on
a raised platform. Vitruvius (v. 1) explains
the plan and uses of this kind of building.
These ‘basilicae ⁷ were the originals of the
modern exchange or bourse. The best
representations of them are the early Chris-
tian churches in Rome, and some of them
exhibit many of the characteristics of the
Roman Basilicae. There are twelve churches
in Rome now which are called Basilicae.
The most perfect Basilica of antiquity is
that of Pompeii, which agrees very well
with the description of Vitruvius. The plan
of the building is 220 feet by 80.

Livy (xxvi. 27) says that in B.C. 210
there was no Basilica at Rome. M. Por-
cius Cato, when Censor, was the first who
erected a Basilica, B.o. 1853 and it was
named Porcia. It was close 0 the Curia
and the Comitium. It was bu 'nt B-C. 54,
and there is no account of its having been
rebuilt. The second Basilica was built
(B.c. 180) in the eensorship of Aemilius
Lepidus and M. Fulvius Nobilior. This
was called Basilica Aemilia et Fulvia (Varro,
L. L. vi. 2) ; but it is commonly called
Aemilia. The next was the Basilica J ulia,
built in the midst of the Forum. A 80111-
pronia, built by the censor, T. Sempro-
nius Gracchus (B.C. 170), is also men-
tioned.

On the Roman Basilicae see Becker's
Handbuch, i. p. 300; and the article Ba-
silicae in the Penny Cyclopaedia. It would
be out of place to 5111 111010 of these Ba-
silicae, or to discuss their position in Rome.
