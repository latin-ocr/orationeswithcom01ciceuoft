LIB. III. c. 47. 427

The average weight of an English bushel of wheat on the land here
referred to would be 621bs. I am not aware that there is any authority
sor the weight of a bushel of Sieilian corn; but it would probably be the
same that it is now, and I suppose that the hard corn of the south of
Europe weighs heavier than English grain. The gross produce on the
best Sicilian land, according to Cicero's statement, in the most favour-
able years, was only equal to the average of the English produce. On
the poor lauds we must assume it to be only one-half.

The following facts are from the same authority that I have referred
toz—In 1845, six pieces of land, measuring half au acre each, were
sown with one bushel each, of six different kinds of wheat. The fo]-
lowing was the result, as given by Mr. O. Hillyard, who tried the
experiment to determine the most productive kind of wheat.

The large amount of produce raised by the best farmers in Scotland
under what is called high sax-ming, appears from an article in Black-
wood's Magazine, 1850, p. 94«. The eost of getting a large produce is
not a matter that comes into question here. But it may be well to
observe, for the benefit of those who look only to results, without con-
sidering how they are produced, that a smaller crop in some countries
may be more profitable to the grower than a larger crop in other coun-
tries. The larger crop may eost so much as to bring its net value to
the grower below the net value of the smaller crop.

In the rich lands of North American a crop of corn is produced at
small eost aster the land is cleared. An old traveller, Miehaux³ (1802),
speaks of 25 to 30 bushels the acro in Kentueky, weighing GOlbs. the-
bushel, raised with no application of manure and little tilluge. · Neai·
Wheeling,011 the Ohio, he speaks os 15 to 20 bushels the acre, when the
land is cleared; but no manure is used, there is little tillage, and the
soil is never idle. 111Alabama‚in 323 N. lat„ the wheat is generally
sown on inferior laud, aud put in with very little care. It is reaped
early in May, about which time wheat is also cut in some parts of Sicily.
