fact of the ground being too rich for that grain (p. 332); for which
reason they sowed rye on the best soils and wheat on the worst. The
Limagne at that time never rested in a fallow3 and the cultivation was
very bad. Young estimated the average produce of wheat in England
at twenty-four bushels the acre, “ which,'' he says, “ forms a vast supe-
riority to eighteen‚ the produce of France, amounting to twelve for one
of the seed, instead of six for one3 but the superiority is greater than is
apparent in the proportion of those two numbers3 for the corn of Eng-
land, as far as respects dressing, that is, cleaning from dirt, chaff, seeds
of weeds, &c.‚ is as much better than that of France, as would make the
difference at least twenty-five, instead of twenty-four, to eighteen3 and
I am inclined to think even more.''

The average produce of wheat in England, or perhaps in the United
Kffigdom, is still said to be twenty-four bushels3 but one would expect
that the average should be higher now than when Young wrote.

I am informed on the authority of an experieneed agriculturist ι, that
on good land in Eugland, of the kind suited for the growth of wheat, and
fairly sarmed, such as that of the Vale of White Herse in Berkshire,
the average quantity of wheat sown on a statute acre is 2-25 bushels,
and that the average produce is 36 bushels. On such land a smaller
quantity of seed would be sufficient, especially if dibbled. It is stated,
however, by the same authority, that there have been instances of 60
and even 65 bushels of wheat being produced on an acre of ground in
England3 and in the years 1835 and 1844 many thousands of acres
gave an average produce of 48 bushels ². The average produce of an acre
in England is usually estimated at 24 bushels.

The Roman ‘jugerum’ was a measure of surface‚ 240 feet in length
and 120 in breadth, and accordingly contained 28,800 square feet
(Roman). The ‘jugerum ’ is estimated at nearly five-eighths of the
English acre. The ‘modius’ is estimated at 1 gallon 736 pints3 and,
as the ‘ medimnum ’ contained 6 ‘ modii ' (Lib. 3. c. 45, 46), the capacity
of the ‘medimnum' is 11·52 gallons. The comparative produce will
stand thus 2—-

2 1 have heard of a crop of ten quarters of barley the acre on a s'm acre field near
Cl1ichester.-—In 1861 Mr. F. F. Hallett grew 57 bushels of wheat the acre on a ten
acre field. The straw was 140 ‘ei—usses, 3fflbs. each. The seed was one peck the acre 3
and so one bushel of seed produced 228 bushels. (See p. 428.)
