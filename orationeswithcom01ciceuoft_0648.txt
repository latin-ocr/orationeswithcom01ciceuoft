628 LIB. V. c. 54.

to his engagement. When he came, there was no plaintiff (quum
ageret nemo), not even the fellow to whom Servilius had given ‘ vadi-
monium.’ The only way to understand the story is to take Cicero's
statements, and to add nothing to them. There was no ‘actor’ or
plaintiff, we are told, when Servilius came to Lilybaeum, and yet Verres
forced Servilius to make a‘sponsio’ with one of his lictors, as if the
matter of the action was already known, and as if the lictor was the man
who had commenced the action. Or the case was this, Verres finding
that he had Servilius in his hands, simply at once ordered him to make
a ‘ sponsio’ with his lictor about a charge of ‘furtum,' without any
preliminary proceedings, and without any respect to the matter of the
‘ vadimonium.’ It makes no matter which way it was. Either way the
act of Verres was irregular. Servilius refused to make the ‘ sponsio’ on
the ground that there was no ‘ adversarius,’ no plaintiff in the action in
respect of which he had given the ‘ vadimonium :⁷ and that was true for
two reasons, first, because a ⁶ Venerius servus ’ could not maintain an
action against any body, and second, because he had failed to make his
appearance, as we must assume, if Servilius on reaching Lilybaeum
found no plaintiff there. Verres’ next step was to order his lictors to
beat Servilius till he cried out ‘ spondeo.’ This proceeding was just as
legal or as illegal as all the rest. Servilius died soon after, and Verres,
I suppose, took his property, or some of it.

Can any thing be plainer than this, that the whole proceeding from
the beginning to the end, which was the murder of Servilius, had not
even a show of legal procedure in it, though some legal ternis and forms
were used? The ‘ praetor ' contrived to bring Servilius to Lilybaeum as
a defendant in an impossible suit, and there he murdered him.

If Cicero has told us all the facts, there is no other explanation than
this which I give. If he has not told all, it is useless to attempt to find
out what he has not told us, and to give something of a legal character
to a transaction which was altogether contrary to law and not conform-
able even to the simplest legal principles.

After this I need hardly remark that hlommsen’s explanation is of no
value. It is faulty both in respect to what it contains and in respect to
what it omits.
