260 IN O. VERREM

ex utroque genere par numerus reliquus esset, veterem cooptari
necesse erat legibus ut is amplior numerus esset. Quae quum ita
se res haberet, tamen ad istum emptum venerunt illum locum sena-
torium non solum veteres verum etiam novi. Fit ut pretio novus
Vincat literasque a praetore auferat. Agrigentini ad istum legatos
mittunt qui eum leges doceant consuetudinemque omnium annorum
demonstrent, ut iste intelligeret ei se illum locum vendidisse, cui «
ne commercium quidem esse oporteret. Quorum oratione iste,
quum pretium jam accepisset, ne tantulum quidem commotus est.
Idem fecit Heracliae. Nam eo quoque colonos P. Rupilius de-
duxit, legesque similes de cooptando senatu et de numero veterum
ac novorum dedit. Ibi non solum iste ut apud ceteros pecuniam
accepit, sed etiam genera veterum ac novorum numerumque per-
miscuit. LI. Nolite exspectare dum omnes obeam oratione mea
civitates. Hoc uno complector omnia, neminem isto praetore sena-
torem fieri potuisse nisi qui isti pecuniam dedisset. Hoc idem
transfero in magistratus, curationes, sacerdotia3 quibus in rebus
non solum hominum jura sed etiam deorum immortalium religiones
omnes repudiavit.

Herac- p. 407, and his note on the words
‘nisi in demortui damnative locum? It
seems that the Romans did not say ‘in
mortui locum? (See Livy, xxiii. 20.) Ma-
zochi’s explanation of the reason for using

oporteret.’ But V has ‘ cui neque . . .

Zumpt gives ‘ Heracliae ’
from Lg. 42 p. m.‚ in place of the common
reading ‘ Heracleae ς’ and he says that the

the word ‘demortuus' is perhaps more

and Iordan from V; which reading may
by some be preferred. But ‘auferat ' Lg.
42 is the true word.

commercium] This term is not used by
Cicero with strict propriety here. In its
legal or politica] sense it signifies generally
the power or capacity to buy and 5811, not
to buy and sell generally, but the symbo-
lical buying which the Romans caUed
‘mancipatio ,·' and this strict sense of ‘com-
mercium' was extended to other legal
transactions. In this case a thing was
sold which was not vendible, and Cicero's
expression means, that, achnitting it to be
a purchase, the pure-haser was a man who
was incapacitated from acquiring.-Klotz

used indifferently by the Romans to repre-
sent the Greek εια. Heraclia, called also Mi-
noa, was on the south coast of Sicily, near
the mouth of the river Halycus (Platani).
51. Jovis sacerdotem] Diodorus (xvi.
70) says that “Timoleon, after having made
the younger Dionysius retire from Syracuse
(B.C. 356), established the annual most ho-
nourable office, which the Syracusans call
the ministry (ἀμφιπολία) of Zeus Olym-
pius, and the first who was chosen minister
of Zeus Olympius was Callimenes, and from
this time the Syracusans reckoned their
years by these magistrates (ἄρχοντες), until
the writing of this history, and the change
in their political condition ; for, when the
Romans made the Siceliots participators of
the citizenship, the office of the ministers
was lowered, having continued more than
three hundred years.'' It lasted then till
