Cicero could giv e them these names. Cicero
says he made several men of good character
his ‘heredes' If they turned ont to be
knaves, when they were put to the test,
there is nothing strange in that. Zumpt
explains it thus z “ viros bonos, i. e. rei pub-
licae, qualis tum constituta erat, amicos,
nobilitatis fautores, ne P. Trebonium ipsum
judices Marianarum partium asseclam clan-
destinum putarent 3³² and 116 15 probably
right, for Cicero's ‘viri boni' is often so
used in a politica] sense.-—‘ in his ε’ Iordan,
following V, has (111 115,’ which is not the

ι true form in this case.

quae . . . vetaret] Orelli and Iordan have
‘vetat,' which makes the expression ‘quae
. . . vetat ’ the remark of Cicer03 but Orelli
thinks that the words are a gloss. Zumpt
has ‘ vetaret,' an emendation of Ernesti3
and we now know that V has VATAIIT,
which may be ‘ vetaret ’ (Halm).

This Lex Cornelia was 0116 of those
passed in the dictatorship of Sulla, a ‘lex
de proscribendis malis civibus,’ an expres-
sion which helps to explain Cicero’s ‘viri
boni.' Cicero (Pro Sex. Ros. Am. c. 43)
says that he does not know whether this
‘lex ' should be called Valeria (Valerii
Flacci interregis) or Cornelia.

dat his possessionem] ‘Injuste‚' (1116-
gally,' says Asconius, the false, in this in-
stance at least. He says that the test-ament
should either have been declax-ed invalid, as

*contrary to the ch Cornelia, or the entire
Δ16111 of the testator should have been ob-

scr.ved But Cicero says ‘id ego non repre-

hendo? and 116 could not find fault with
this p· n·t of the decision of Verres. It does
not appear that the ‘jusjurandum' was a
‘ conditio ' (suspensive, or precedent) which
must be performed before the persons
named as ‘heredes‘ could be ‘ heredes.³ If

it was, the praetor could excuse the oath
(that 15, ‘remittere conditionem ³3) but still
thc‘ 1161·61165’ might be required to fulfil the
‘conditio' in ῖ116εἱ form of a (111011115,’ that 15,
if it was not illegal. If, however, any party
who was named ‘heres ’ chose to take thc
oath, he could do so, and he might be com-
pelled to perform the ⁵ conditio ' as a (1110-
dus. ³ The following is an ex imple of a
‘modus’ A testator might leave 1115 pro-
pei ty to a pei 5011 and add that he must do
some particular thing3 for instance, raise a
monument to him. ln this case the person

was bound to do what the testator 11 1511611.

way impos 5511116, ζῖ0116( heres' 11· 65 released
fr 0111 the obligation to do it, and his right
and title as ‘heres’ were not at all impaired.
If the thing was illegaL the conclusion was
the same. Now in this case the praetor
ought to have given the ‘possessio ³ to all, to
those who did not take the oath and to him
who did. Those who did not take the oath
would not be bound by the‘ modus? if the
thing 11· 65 illegal3 and he who took the oath,
if 116 performed the ‘modus,' would be lia-
ble to the penalty of the Lex Cornelia, if
the penalty applied to this case. Cicero' 5
statement and arguments are quite correct.
