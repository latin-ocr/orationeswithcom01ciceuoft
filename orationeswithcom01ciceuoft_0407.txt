tion is hardly satisfactory. When the
offence of ‘ peculatus ’ became common, it
was the subject of particular enactments
(leges); and finally, at some time not as-

the vectigal of wheat, of barley, which was
let separately in Sicily, of wine, oil, and of
the ‘fruges minutae‚'—all mentioned by
Cicero, and these make exaetly six. Klotz

is delighted to be able to defend ‘ sex pub-
lica ’ by a pertinent example from Valerius
Maximus, vi. 9, ξ 7 z “ T. Aufidius eum
Asiatici publici exiguam admodum parti-
culam habuisset, postea Asiam proconsu-
lari imperio obtinuit? See the passage
from Gaius cited in the note to c. 72 ; and
the note in Torrenius' edition of Valerius
Maximus. There are numerous examples
in which ‘ publica' and ‘ publicum ' mean
something which belongs to the ‘ populns,’
and some kind of public revenue (Ovid,
Fast. v. 283; Horace, 1 Ep. i. 773 Seneca,
Ep. 101, 119. See De Imp. Cn. Pomp. c.
¹7, and the note).

there is no MSS. authority sor it.

72. peculatum ,·] ‘ Peeulutus ' was the
ofl'cnce of embezzling public property (pc-
cunia publica), whether the oll'encc was
committed by a private person, or by one
who held some public ollice.. According to
the Rolnam, the word was derived from
‘ pecus ;' and as fines were paid originally
not in money, but in cattle, it was pro-
perly the embezzlenient of what was so
paid ns a fine to the state. The explana-

certained, there was established a ‘quaes-
tio perpetua de peeulatu‚' ora court for
the trial of the offenders in this matter.
Cases of ‘peculatus' appear to have he-
come more common when the Romans
began their conquering career, and gene-
rals were tempted to appropriate some of
the booty. 'l‘he ‘quaestio ' existed before
this time (11.0. 70). 'rho chief ‘lex' ou
this subject is a. Lex Julia, of the time.

perseriplorem] He was the man who
made all the entries in the books relating
to these transactions. The sense of ‘per-
scribere’ is explained by other passages
(Lib. 5. c. 19) ι “ multus pecunias isti ero-
gatus in operum locationes salsas atquc
inanes esse perscriptnS.'' Lib. 2. e. 70,
“furta quoque istius permulta nominatim
ad socios perseripserat.'’ As to the various
meanings of ‘perscriptio' and ‘perseri-
bere,' see Ernesti, Clavis.

scribae] “And it happened that two
‘ scribae ' were at that time ‘ magistri ’ to-
gether with Vettius? Difficulties have
been made about this. Itis usual to speak
of only one ‘magister-2 Hero three are
