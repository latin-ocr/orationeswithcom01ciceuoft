EDICTA MAGISTRATUUM. 189

Under these circumstances and by these means was formed a body
of Roman law applicable both to Peregrini and to Romans. This law
is the Roman Jus Gentium in its original sense3 a law which arose from
a practical necessity, and was adapted to cases of dealings between
Peregrini and Romans. As the term implies, this law was not limited
in its application to a single Gens, but it was a law of a general
character, applicable to many Gentes, and a law which grew up
within the Roman territory. It was a law formed for those who, not
being Cives Romani, could not be made subjects of the Jus Civile, which
was ‘proprium Romanorum ².’ This practical notion being established,
it was an easy step to view the Jus Gentium as a general law applicable
to the Romans and to all people. The Romans, having emerged from
the strict and narrow system of their Jus Civile, saw that there was
something more general and comprehensive; that besides a ‘ civilis ratio‚'
as they termed it, a Roman law founded on Roman notioris, there was a
‘naturalis ratio 3’ there was something which was common to all law
and to all peoples3 and so the Jus Gentium, which was developed with-
out interfering with the J us Civile, was extended from its original narrow
limits to express the idea of law in its more general sense and more
extended application. The Jus Gentium did not rise out of any specu-
lative notions3 it had a purely practica] origin3 and when we look at
the definitions given of it by the Roman jurists, we must remember that
they had attained to this generalizing notion by actually contemplating
what had been produced in a practical way ³.

The Jus Gentium received its efficient form from the Edicta of the
Magistratus. It became law for Peregrini by the Edictum of the
Praetor Peregrinus and by the Provincial Edicta3 and law for the
Romans by the Edicta of the Praetor Urbanus,

Many rules of law were both Juris Gentium and Juris Civilis. Most
of the contracts of daily life, such as buying and selling‚ letting and
hiring, delivery and corresponding possession as a mode of acquiring
ownership‚ were common to the Romans and other nations. But tho
Romans had many positive institutions which were peculiar to the1n;
marriage, which could only be contracted between Roman citizens; the
Patria. Potestas, and Agnati0; many of the modes of acquiring
ownership (Mancipatio‚ Usucapio); certain peculiar forms of contract3
and all that related to testaments and to succession to intestatos.
But oven these positive institutions contain some general principle,

² Thus Gaius (iii. 93) speaks of the Stipulatio us an “obligatio propria civium
Romanornni.”

acquo custoditur vocaturque J us Gentium.'' Gaius, i. 1. Sco tho Note at the end os
