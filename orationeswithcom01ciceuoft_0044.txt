26 IN Q. CAECILIUM

ut homines te non solum audiant, verum etiam libenter studioseque
audiant. In quo si te multum natura adjuvaret, si optimis apuer-
itia disciplinis atque artibus studuisses et in his elaborasses, si
litteras Graecas Athenis non Lilybaei, Latinas Romae non in Sicilia
didicisses, tamen esset magnum tantam causam, tam exspectatam
et diligentia consequi, et memoria complecti, et oratione expromere,
et voce ac viribus sustinere. Fortasse dices, Quid ergo haec in te
sunt omnia? Utinam quidem essent : verumtamen ut esse possent ⁸
magno studio mihi a pueritia est elaboratum. Quod si ego haec
propter magnitudinem rerum ac difficultatem assequi non potui,
quiin omni vita nihil aliud egi; quam longe tu te ab his rebus
abesse arbitrare, quas non modo antea nunquam cogitasti, sed ne
nunc quidem quum in eas ingrederis quae et quantae sint suspicari
potes Ρ1 XIII. Ego qui, siout omnes sciunt, in foro judiciisque ita
verser‘ut ejusdem aetatis aut nemo aut pauci plures causas defen-
derint, et qui omne tempus quod mihi ab amicorum negotiis datur

MSS. are divided.

litteras Graecas, KQ] Cicero exults over
his poor opponent, whose Greek aud Latin
were equally bad. His Grreek was the dia-
lect of Lilybaeum, not the pure language
of Athens3 and his Latin was picked up in
Sicily, not learned in Rome. Plautus
(Persa, iii. 1. 66) has a sneer on the Greek
dialect of Sicily.—‘ expromere ε’ ‘ expo-
nere' dtt. But Halm suggests ‘expri-
mcre,' which may be the true reading.

13. Eyo {sui . . . verser . . . consummana]
There is a reading ‘versor' G2 Ld, but
110 various reading ‘consumo.’ It does
not seem easy to explain the use of the
subjunctive here, and to reconcile it with
the indicative ¹ qui nihil aliud egi,’ which
occurs at the end of the preceding chapter.
But the two cases are different; and I
observe, by way of suggestion, that the use
of the indicative or subjimctive seems to
depend, in such 63666, 111 601116 degree 011
the position which the ‘qui' has in the
sentence. The indicative ‘ qui . . . egi‚' is
a positive affirmation ε ‘ if Ι have not been
able to accomplish this, Ι who have la-
boured at nothing else all my life.> The
words ‘qui . . . egi ³ are an emphatic de-
scription of the ‘ego' as the subject of
‘assequi non potui.' The other sentence

. . . ‚ still I am not only much excited in
my mind (tamen . . . non 60111111 commoveor
animo). The words ‘ qui . . . verser ' &ca
are not a description of the ‘eg0,' but
matter contingent and subordinate, a cir-
cumstance affecting the ‘ego,’ and 0116
which makes the affirmation in the sentence
(commoveor, perhorresco) more striking.
This use of ‘ qui’ aud the subjunctive, in
place of which modern writers of Latin
often use ‘ quum,' is a great nicety 111 the
Latin language.

ita milei deos celim, dja] This is a
usual form of solemn asseveration : ‘ so may
the gods help me, as what Ι say is true.'
But in this formula the ‘ut ² may be
omitted, “ita me dii bene ament, non nihil
timeo‚” Ter. Eun. 4. 1. 1.

quum illius temporis mihi venit, ἐξα]
There are other examples of ‘ mihi venit in
mentem ' with a genitive, which is probably
an elliptical expression, the nominative, on
which the genitive should depend, being
omitted. Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 18, “ 11011 du-
bito quin . . tuorum tibi scelerum veniat in
mentem.” (Pro P. Quintio, c. 23 Pro P.
Sulla, c. 6.) It is also a form of expression
which Terence usos ,- aud Cicero was a
great rcader of Terence.
