AOT. Π. LIBER SECUNDUS. 293

nequitia, vestros animos in aliam partem fortitudinis comme-
moratione traducat? At homo inertior, ignavior, magis vir inter
mulieres, impura inter viros muliercula proferri non potest. At
mores commodi. Quis contumacior? quis inhumanior? quis super-
bior? At haec sine cujusquam malo. Quis acerbior? quis insi-
diosior? quis crudelior unquam fuit? In hoc homine atque in
ejusmodi causa quid facerent omnes Crassi et Antonii? Tantum,
opinor, Hortensi: ad causam non accederent neque in alterius
impudentia sui pudoris existimationem amitterent. Liberi enim ad
causas solutique veniebant, neque committebant ut si impudentes
in defendendo esse noluissent ingrati in deserendo existimarentur.

impura] “ Lego: ‘magis vir inter mu-
lieres, inter viros muliercula ;' cetera sine
dubitatione librariis adscribo,'’ Garatoni,
who gives his reasons for this proposed
change. Iordan thinks that his specious
argument is not sufficient to induce us to
make the change. Nor do I think that it
is. Zumpt remarks that ‘magis ’ must also
be referred to ‘ impura.’

in alterius impudentia] The use of the
preposition ‘in’ with the ablativa is very
extensive, and I have not seen it well
explained. The sense can only be reached
by carefully looking at the context. Caesar
has examples, for instance (B. G. i. 33), ‘in
tanto imperio,' ‘when the Romans had so
great an empire 3’ Cicero, Pro Caelio, e. 19,
‘in tantis praemiis eloquentiae‚’ ‘ when
there are such rewards for eloquence.' The
text means ‘they would not throw away
their own self-respect by defending the
shameless conduct of a client.’ That is the
meaning, but it may be expressed other-
wise aud perhaps better. Cicero's remark
is good, and some wise advocates don't
neglect it now. A man may do his best
for his client, but he must think of himself

too.

Liberi nge] Klotz observes that this is
an allusion to the relationship that subsisted
between Verres and Hortensius, who is said
to have received from Verres many costly
works of art, and he was therefore not
‘liber et solutus,’ being under obligations
to him. He also came within the tei-ms of
the Lex Cincia de donis et muneribus, at
least if he had received any presents for de-
fending Verres. Among other things, Hor-
tensius is said to have received a sphinx of
excellent workmanship, about which a joke
of Cicero's is recorded by Plutarch (Cicero,
c. 7); Quintilian (Inst. Or. vi. c. 3. ξ 93);
and Pliny (H. N. xxxiv, 18).

In place of ‘noluissent' some editions
have ‘ voluissent ;’ and ‘voluissent’ is the
reading of Lg. 29 42 φ ψ. These two
words have sometimes been intercllanged
in the MSS.; but ‘noluissent ' is the right
reading here. ‘ These old orators used to
come to a case perfectly free aud un-
shacklcd, and they took care not to act in
such a way that, if they did not choose to
be shameless in conducting a defence, they
could be charged with ingratitude for
declining it?
