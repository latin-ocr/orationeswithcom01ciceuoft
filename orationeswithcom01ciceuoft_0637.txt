AOT. ΙΙ. LIBER QUINTUS. 617

Romanum ; scelus verberare 3 prope parricidium necare: quid dicam
in crucem tollere Ρ verbo satis digno tam nefaria res appellari nullo
modo potest. Non fuit his omnibus iste contentus. Spectet,
inquit, patriam3 in conspectu legum libertatisque moriatur. N on
tu hoc loco Gavium, non unum hominem nescio quem, [civem Ro-
manum‚] sed communem libertatis et civitatis causam in illum cru-
ciatum et crucem egisti. J am vero videte hominis audaciam.
Nonne eum graviter tulisse arbitramini quod illam civibus Romanis
crucem non posset in foro, non in comitio, non in rostris defigere P
Quod enim his locis in provincia sua, celebritate simillimum, regione
proximum potuit, elegit: monumentum sceleris audaciaeque suae
voluit esse in conspectu Italiae, vestibulo Siciliae, praetervectione
omnium qui ultro citroque navigarent.

been proposed to consider it as a shorter
form of ‘parenticidium ;' and also, as formed
of ‘par' and ‘cid,' the killing of onc's

vincire . . verberare ,- . . necare .· . . tol-
lere ?] It is singular that the MSS„ ex-
cept Lg. 29, should have the passive forms

in the first three words, and keep the
active ‘tollere.’ It seems clear that the
active forms are required, and Quintilian
cites the passage so (Inst. viii. 4. 4).

prope parricidium] That is ‘murder.' It
does not appear that the Romans had any
name for murder except ‘parricidium ς’ for
‘ homicidium ' seems not to have come into
use before the imperial period. Cicero
means murder in this passage. The com-
mon explanation of this word is, that it is
equivalent to ‘patricidium ς’ but it is diffi-
cult to sce why the genuine form should
not have been kept as in ‘patrimonium.’
It was the opinion of antiquity, that the
word meant litei-any ‘ parricide,’ or the kill-
ing of a father hy ason. Plutarch (Romu-
lus, (τ. 22) says that Romulus named all
homicide πατροκτονία, a statement that
has of course no historieal valum but it
shows how Plutarch understood the word
‘ parricidium? Paulus Dim-onus, v. l’arriei
Quaestores, p.221‚ Miiller, says: “ Nam par-
ricida uon utique isqui parentem occidisset
dicebatur, sed qualemcunque hominem in-
demnatum. lta fuisse indicat lex Numae
Pompilii regis his emnposita verbis: Si qui
hominem liberum dolo sciens morti duit,
parricidas esto.'' This is explained to mean
that all malicious homicide was to be treated
as parricide, and tried before the same
court.

Besides the derivation of ‘parricidium’
from ‘patri’ and ‘cid’ (cuod-ere), it has

equal. The latest and the worst attempt is
that of E. Osenbriiggen (Das Alt-Romisehe
Parricidium, Kiel, 1841), who derives it
ultimately from the sanserit ‘ para,' signify-
ing, as hc explains it, ‘ cmming‚’ ‘per-
verted ς’ and so he would explain ‘ parrici-
dium ’ to be death caused by treachery or
malice (dolo sciens), and it would signify
what we eall murder, and not the death of
a father. From this original signification
he supposes that murder in later times was
distributed intovarious kinds, ⁴ homicidinm,'
‘ veneficium,' and ⁴ parricidium ' in the nar·
rower sense. But the passages of Roman
authors show that parricide in our sense is
the original signification of ‘parri‹·idium,'
and that is a sufficient answer to Osenhriig-
gen. This subject is one of considerable.
‹lifficultffi but the explanation most eon-
sistent with the use of ¹ parricidium ’ by the
Roman writers, is that it. does properly sig-
nify ‘ parricide,’ and that the nanie lwcame
generally applied to any atrocious murder.
ln this sense we can understand ‘parricida
patriae,' or ‘ rei publicae.5 ln this passage
Cicero says ‘prope parricidhnn? lt was
not therefore quite ‘parricidium.’ There
is a title. in the big. 118. a, ‘De Lege l‘om—
peia de parricidiis) This subject is dis-
cussed by Osenbriiggen. and in Rein. Das
