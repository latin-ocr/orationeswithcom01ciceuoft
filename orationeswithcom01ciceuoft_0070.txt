52 JUDIOIA.

having been enacted in due form. The Lex Plautia, Β.0. 89, enacted
that fifteen Judices should be elected from each tribe, without any
respect to the class of persons. When the party of the Optimates under
Sulla had got all the power in their hands, a Lex Cornelia (11.0. 80)
again gave the ,Iudicia to the Senate. This Lex Cornelia was repealed
by the Aurelia, Β.0. 70, the agitation for which was going on at the time
of the prosecution of Verres. The Aurelia made the Judices eligible
from the Senators, Equites, and Tribuni Aerarii. A Lex Julia subse-
quently deprived the Tribuni Aerarii of the judicia] functions, and gave
them to the Senators and Equites.

It is plain from this sketch that the disputes as to the constitution of
the Judicia and the class of persons from whom the Judices were to be
chosen, did not relate to the Judicia Privata, a term which we find used
by Cicero (Top. 17). The Romans had a permanent court for the deci-
sion os many civil actions, called the court of the Centumviri, the origin
and constitution of which are very uncertain. At the time when we are
best acquainted with it, this court had a very extensive jurisdiction,
especially in matters relating to an Hereditas. Cicero in a passage of
the De Oratore (i. 38) enumerates some of the many questions which
belonged to the jurisdiction of this court3 and from this passage we
may conclude that at one time at least, this court decided on all matters
in dispute with respect to property in land. At an earlier period, how-
ever, private persons, who held no official situation, were appointed by
a magistrate for the hearing and determining of civil actions, and such
J udices were called Privati, as being opposed to those who acted as Ju-
dices by virtue of any office. There might be various reasons for the
appointment of such J udices Privati. The permanent courts might not
be adapted for the investigation of all questions3 or they might not have
time 3 or cases might arise in which some particular kind of knowledge
was necessary in order to enable a ‚Iudex to come to a just decision3
and finally the intercourse between Romans and Peregrini might render
this form of procedure necessary in many cases. A Lex Pinaria of
early date (Gaius, v. 15), 111 the case of a Legis Aetio Sacramenta,
allowed the parties to apply for a J udex, whom the Praetor named
within thirty days after tlie application3 and this appears to be the
earliest notice that we have of the appointment of a J udex, though it
does not follow that this Lex established the practice. It is certain
that the practice of appointing a J udex for the hearing and determining
of matters between individuals, was well adapted to the wants of the
Romans, and that the practice gradually was extended, and the perma-
nent courts for the decision of civil matters were much less employed.
This change may have originated in the circumstance of the permanent
