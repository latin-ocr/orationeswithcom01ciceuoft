174 LEX VOCONIA.

When Cicero mentions the terms of the Lex Voconia, he says
nothing of the 1ΟΟ,ΟΟΟ Sestertii3 and Asconius, who saw the omission
in the text, endeavoured to complete it by stating the amount, and
giving an explanation, which is a bad one. He did know, however,
that the Lex mentioned 1ΟΟ,ΟΟΟ sestertii, and, as he could not find this
in the text of Cicero, he must have found it somewhere else. Savigny's
explanation of the omission of the 1ΟΟ,ΟΟΟ Sestertii by Cicero is satis·
factory. The orator’s object was not to state minutely the provisions*
of the Lex. It was enough to show that the Edict of Verres was in
opposition to its most important provision. Annius was notoriously
rich3 every body knew that he was worth more than 100‚000 sestertii.
But the amount of his property was immaterial in this case. He was
not ‘ census,’ and therefore the Lex could not apply to the property of
such a testator. The simple fact is, that if a man was census and had a.
property of one hundred thousand, he could not make a. woman his
‘heres’

The object of the legislator is supposed to have been to prevent
women being enriched by testamentary donations, and so to check the
influence which is a consequence of wealth3 or, in other terms, to pre-
vent the evils which generally follow from great wealth being at the
disposal of women. But this explanation, though it may contain some
truth‚ is not sufficient. Cato the Censor spoke in favour of the Lex at
the time when it was proposed to the people ; and he was one of those
who were for keeping women under proper restraint.

Another clause of the Lex referred to legacies (legata). It declared
that no legatee (legatarius) should take more under a testament than
thewamount which should remain to the ‘heres’ 01· to the ‘heredes’
after he or they had paid the lcgacy3 and this provision also applied
only to a testator who was ‘census’ (Cic. In Ver. Actssi2 Lib. 1. ᾖ,
c. 433 Gaius, ii. 226). Gaius does not mention the provision as to
legacies, and for a good reason; the subsequent Lex Falcidia had
entirely repealed this part of the Lex Voconia. In speaking of this
clause also of the Lex, Cicero does not mention the 100,000 Sestertii,
but we may conclude, that he means a person who was ‘census’ at
100‚000 Sestertii. From these passages it appears that this prohibition
of the Lex was not limited to legacies to women 3 and yet the Lex con-
tained something about legacies to women, as appears from Cicero (De
Re Publica, iii. 10), ‘de mulierum legatis et hereditatibus.' Indeed
the Lex would have been a very imperfect thing, if it had only provided
for the case of a female ‘ heres,' and not for the case of a female legatee.
A passage in Quintillian (Declamat. No. 264), if we can rely on it,
shows that the Lex did not allow a woman to take as legatee more
than one-half of the testator's property.
