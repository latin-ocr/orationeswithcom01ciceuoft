ACT. II. LIBER TERTIUS. 405

esse soleat: video quot dierum via sit: video Philomeliensibus
expedire, quanti Ephesi sit frumentum, [tantum] dare potius in
Phrygia quam Ephesum portare aut ad emendum frumentum
Ephesum pecuniam et legatos mittere. In Sicilia vero quid ejus-
modi est? Henna mediterranea est maxime. Ooge ut ad aquam
tibi, id quod summi juris est, frumentum Hennenses metiantur vel
Phintiam vel Halesam vel Catinam, loca inter se maxime diversa:
eodem die quo jusseris deportabunt. Tametsi ne vectura quidem
est opus. Nam totus quaestus hic, judices, aestimationis ex
annonae natus est varietate. Hoc enim magistratus in provincia
assequi potest, ut ibi accipiat ubi est carissimum. Ideo valet ista
ratio aestimationis in Asia3 valet in Hispania3 valet in his pro-
vinciis in quibus unum pretium frumento esse non solet. In Sicilia
vero quid cujusquam intererat quo 1000 daret? neque enim portan-
dum erat; et quo quisque vehere jussus esset, ibi tanti frumentum
emeret quanti domi vendidisset. Quamobrem si vis, Hortensi,
docere aliquid ab isto simile in aestimatione atque a ceteris esse
factum, doceas oportebit aliquo in loco Siciliae praetore Verre
ternis denariis tritici modium fuisse.

only have acted like other governors‚ in

Akshehr, where there are ruins and in-

scriptions, is supposed by some of the
most recent authorities to be the place.
(Hamilton, Rcsearchcs in Asia Minor, i.
472, ii. 1840) Cicero takes an instance
from the province of Asia, where Ephesus
was the head-‹pulrters of the Roman go-
vernor. We collect- from this chapter and
elsewhere that the governor could require
the corn to be delivered at any place, and
of course at the place of his residenee. It,
might then, as Cicero say& be for the intc-
rest of the Philomelienses to pay in Phrygia
the price of corn at Ephesus, rather than
eonvey the corn all the way there, and only
receive the governor’s price. This mon-
strous abusc of the Roman governors is
without any excuse, and yet we learn from
Cicero that it was tolerated. The go-
vernor had liis money allowance sor corn,
and might have bought with it ull that he
wanted at Ephesus (for instance), for wo
are to suppose that there was plenty in the
market there, or Cicero would not have
added ‘ ant ad emendum frumentum . . mit-
tere! Cicero admits that if Hortensius
could name a place in Sicily where corn was

Asia and Spain, for example, 111 receiving
three ‘denarii' for every ‘ modius?

Phintiam] Phintia, or Phintias, as
Diodorus writes it, was at the mouth οἰ
the Himera, the larger river of that 11111110,
on the southern side ot' the island. Tho
distanees from Henna to Phintia (now
Alicata, at the mouth ot' the river Salso),
Halesa, and Catina, would not be quite
the longest distance that corn would have
to be carried from the interior to any good
port. If Cicero means to say that they
could carry it down 111 a §gig-le day, he
speaks oratorieally‚ for the distance t'rom
Henna (Castro Giovanni) to Catina is about
forty miles in a direct line. In summer
the roads might be gimd, even 111110)- were
only the natural roads, not ‘ munitae.' But
111 the wet season so rapid a transport is
only an oratorii-al possibility.
