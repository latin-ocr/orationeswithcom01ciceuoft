314 IN O. VERREM

tum repentinum, ‘ Ne quis frumentum de area tolleret antequam
cum decumano pactus esset.' Ferebat hano quoque iniquitatem
Septitius‚ et imbri frumentum corrumpi in area patiebatur, quum
illud edictum repente uberrimum quaestuosissimumque nascitur,
‘ut ante Kalendas Sextiles omnes decumas ad aquam deportatas
haberent.' Hoc edicto non Siculi, nam eos quidem superioribus
edictis satis perdiderat atque afflixerat, sed isti ipsi equites Romani, κ
qui suum jus retinere se contra Apronium posse erant arbitrati,
splendidi homines et aliis praetoribus gratiosi, vincti Apronio tra-
diti sunt. Attendite enim cujusmodi edicta sint: ‘Ne tollat,'
inquit, ‘ex area nisi erit pactus.' Satis haec magna vis est ad
inique paciscendum: malo enim plus dare quam non mature ex
area tollere. At ista vis Septitium et nonnullos Septitii similes
non coercet, qui ita dicunt, Non tollam potius quam paciscar. His
hoc opponitur: Deportatum habeas ante Kalendas Sextiles. De-
portabo igitur. Nisi pactus eris, non commovebis. Sic depor-
tandi dies praestituta tollere cogebat ex area: prohibitio tollendi,
nisi pactus esset, vim adhibebat pactioni non voluntatem.

XV. J am vero illud non solum contra legem Hieronicam nec
solum contra consuetudinem superiorum, sed etiam contra omnia
jura Siculorum, quae habent a senatu populoque Romano, ne quis
extra suum forum vadimonium promittere cogatur. Statuit iste,

area] An ‘area' in a city is a vacant

where other *ωε-11111031 words are explained).
Here it means the floor on which the grain
was trod out, an open place prepared for
this purpose. virgil (Georg. i. 178) gives
directions for making one. The ‘area'
was in the open air, and the corn was
spoiled by the rain. Such an ‘area' is or
was used sometimes in the United StateS,
in a field. The want of a cover for the
corn, when it was trod out, as we must
infer to have been the case in Sicily, shows
a low state of cultivation. The corn must
often have been dirty. Arthur Young
(Travels in France, vol. i. p. 355, 2nd
edition) says of the years 17 87—1789,
“there is not a plank threshing-floor in
France ; and 110 11111101 0311 grind corn as he
receives it from the fariner, without further
cleaning.” Virgil’s ‘area' was made of
earth; and Varro, Cato, and Columella
give pretty nearly the same instructions for
making one.

acl aquam] They were required to carry
down the corn to the sea-coast. Dureau de
la Malle (Economie Politique des Romains,

their ‘ decumae' to the coast. Zumpt thinks
that the edict applied to the ‘ alterae decu-
mae ³ (see c. 82, 83), which were bought of
the Siculi for the 1150 of Rome. And it
seems probable that the regular ‘ decumae '
would be delivered to the ‘decumani' 011
the land of each ‘ arator,' or at some place
within a limited distance. Zumpt appears
to be right in not joining ‘omnes’ with
‘ decumas?

suum jus retinere] Cicero uses ‘ obti-
nere' in the same sense (Lib. 1. 0. 26);
and 500 the use of ‘obtinemus’ (Lib. 3. c.

is the place to which the people of a certain
district resorted to settle their legal dis-
putes, and for other court business ; it is
also the court-house of a district, and hence
the district itself. In the next sentence
most of the MSS. have erroneously ‘ quod
vellet.' But compare c. 20, and c. 34,
