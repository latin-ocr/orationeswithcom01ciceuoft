NOTE.

As there is room here, Ι have a remark to make, which ought to
be made somewhere. In a work of this kind numerous references are
expected, and when they are exact, they are useful. Ι have examined
every reference which I have made, and many of them twice3 except in
those cases where Ι had not the books and Ι was obliged to trust to
others. These cases are not numerous, and Ι have always either
directly or indirectly shown that I am not responsible for the accuracy
of some references 3 or if Ι have not always done so, Ι intended to do it.
This making and verifying of references is a most tedious, hateful toil,
and I consider it more real trouble than all the rest. The causes of
error, even when the references are most carefully examined, are many:
for instance, a man does not always copy a reference truly‚ even if he
has the passage before his eyes3 and the most careful and exact of
printers, and such is the printer of this book, may sometimes print
incorrectly what is correct, and the editor may not discover the error,
even if he be as careful as⁴ Ι affirm that I am, without meaning to say
that some people with the same care might not be more exact. There are
other causes of error well known to writers and printers‚ but on this

head Ι have said enough.
Ι do not know how many references there are in this book. If they

average ten a page, they will amount to more than six thousand, many
of them references to Cicero himself, some of them dates, which imply
reference, and others to numerous works and passages useful for the

explanation of these orations.
