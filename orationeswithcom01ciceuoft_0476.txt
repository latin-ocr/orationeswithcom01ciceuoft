458 IN O. VERREM

sederem, inquit, domi tristis, accurrit Venereus : jubet me scyphos
sigillatos ad praetorem statim afferre. Pcrmotus sum, inquit:
binos habebam3 jubeo promi utrosque ne quid plus mali naso-eretur,
et mecum ad praetoris domum ferri. Eo quum venio, praetor
quiescebat : fratres illi Cibyratae inambulabant. Qui me ubi vide-

the figures are separate things, and at-

the Greek term ‘ emblemata,' figures
inlaid (0. 17). 111 0. 21, Cicero speaks of
a ‘patella' on which there were ‘sigilla,'
and Verres took off the ‘ sigilla,' and
·returned the vessel; and in another in-
stance (c. 21) he pulled off the ‘ emblema,'
and returned the ‘ turibulum ' without the
figures. Juvenal (sat. i. 76) t

word was used by Lucilius to indicate a
kind of Mosaic work, or inlaying of small
pieces of various shapes and colours ς and,
metaphoric-ally, it is applied to a style of
writing (Cicero, Orat. 0. 44) :

says ‘scyphorum paria complm·a,' and if
he meant two pairs of cups here, he would

meant simply two, and not a pair, he

Et mehercule cista] Graev‘ius says that
either ‘hoc' or ‘ista' is «superfluous, in
which he is entirely mistaken. It is usual
with Cicero to place ‘ hoc ' thus, and theu
