516 IN O. VERREM

justam excusationem, prope ut concedendum atque ignoscendum
esse videatur. Silanionis opus tam perfectum, tam elegans, tam
elaboratum, quisquam non modo privatus sed populus potius habe-
ret quam homo elegantissimus atque eruditissimus Verres P Nimi-
rum contra dici nihil potest. Nostrum enim unusquisque, qui tam
beati quam iste est non sumus, tam delicati esse non possumus, si
quando aliquid istiusmodi videre volet, eat ad aedem Felicitatis, ad
monumentum Catuli, in porticum Metelli3 det operam ut admit-
tatur in alicujus istorum Tusculanum3 spectet forum ornatum, si
quid iste suorum aedilibus commodarit z Verres haec habeat domi;
Verres ornamentis fanorum atque oppidorum habeat plenam domum,

villas refertas.

57. Silanionis] He was an Athenian
artist of the age of Lysippus. (Plin. H. N.
xxxiv. 8.) He made also a dying Jocasta
and a statue of Corinna.

Verres, says Cicero, was almost excusable
for taking the Sappho. It was a perfect
work 3 and, besides, it was a woman.

Nimirum contra] This is the sarcastic
answer to the question, the purport of which
is, that nobody is fit to have such fine
works as Verres. ‘ To be sure,' says Cicero,
‘it is so, it can't be contradicted. Verres
is the only man who ought to have such
things.' ‘Nimirum’ means ‘strange if it
were not so.' Terence sometimes says
‘Mirum ni‚' &c. Andria, iii. 4, 19.

ad aedem Felicitatis,] See c. 2. This
temple was built by L. Licinius Lucullus
to commemorate his success in his Celti-
berian campaign, B.C. 151, 150. But his
campaign was a failure, and he ought to
have been punished. After the end of the
Achaean war (B.C. 146) Lucullus asked L.
Mummius to lend him some of the statues
which he had brought from Grcece. Lu-
cullus said he only wanted to decorate his
temple with them till it was consecrated,
and he would then return them. But
Lucullus dedicated the statues with the
temple, and then told Mummius that he
might take them away if hc chose. As
the statues had become sacred things (res
sacrae) by the consecration, Mummius
could not take them back, unless, we may
suppose, the college of Pontifices, which
was the supreme court in matters of reli-
gion, should give him permission. But
Mummius took no notice of the dirty trick,
and so 110 got more credit than Lucullus
who had dedicated the temple. (Strabo,
viii. 381.)

The noble works of Praxiteles in this
temple pei-ished in a fire in the time of

Etiamne hujus operarii studia ac delicias, judices,

Claudius. (Pliny, H. N. xxxiv. 8. 5. 19.)
Fire has devoured of the great works of the
Greeks more than time and barbarians have
destroyed.

monumentum Catuli,] Not the Capitol,
as Zumpt properly reminds 115, but the
temple of Fortuna which Catulus vowed in
the Cimbric war (Plut. Marius, c. 26).
Pliny (H. N. xxxiv. 19) speaks of it.

porticum Metelli 5] Of Q. Metellus Ma-
cedonicus in the ninth ‘regio' of the city
(Plin. H. N. xxxiv. 14). It was built after
his triumph over Macedonia, Rc. 146. On
the place see Becker, Handbuch der Rom.
Alterthiim. i. p. 608. Pliny says that this
Porticus contained the statue of Cornelia,
the mother of the Gracchi. Plutarch
mentions a statue of Cornelia (C. Gracch.
c. 4).

Tusculanum ;] Some of the wealthy
Romans had ‘ villae' at Tusculum (Frascati)
adorned with sculptureS. Cicero himself
had one a few years later, which he 01111101-
lished at great cost. He could hardly have
had one now, or he would not here have
used this expression. His progress in wealth,
01· expenditure, at least, was rapid, for a
few years after this date he was spending at
a great rate in adorning his Tusculanum.
Strabo has a passage on Tusculum (p. 239,
ed. Casaub.): he says that “Tusculum is
adorned with plantations about it and
houses, and particularly in the part that is
turned towards Rome, for in those parts
Tusculum is a fertile eminence, and well
watered, and suitable for the most splendid
palatia] structures.''

operarii] An ‘operarius’ is one of the
class of ‘operae‚³ the men with rough hands,
those who do the real work of a country.
It is explained by what follows. Verres
was more fit to be a porter than the pos-
sessor of such treasures. The governor of
