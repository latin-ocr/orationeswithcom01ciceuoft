430 FORMULA OOTAVIAN A.

not a Privatum J udicium, like the Condictiones, or actions brought by
a single injured party : it was a proceeding in the name of a whole pro-
vince, conducted by a prosecutor, before a body of sworn Judices. Yet
the indemnification of the injured parties was still the main object. The
Servilia gave to the proceedings another character. The ‘ nominis dela-
tio,’ the public prosecution before the Praetor Quaesitor, or the Judex
Quaestionis, was the principal thing: the Petitio and the Litis Aesti-
matio occupy a secondary place. If the defendant was condemned, he
did not escape the Litis Aestimatio. “ In this, however, the Litis¹
Aestimatio is independent of the result of the public prosecution, that it
affects even one who has been acquitted, and is applied to him who has
pleaded guilty, without presupposing a condemnation of the defendant
by a body of Judices ².'’ The Servilia raised the amount of damages to
double of the loss sustained3 but only one-half of this sum, or the
amount of loss, went to the injured parties ; the rest went to the treasury
(aerarium). But the proceedings were not confined to the guilty
pers0n3 they extended to his ‘heredes,' or representatives, and to the
‘heredes ’ of the ‘heredes’ Even innocent third personS, who might
have been enriched, that is, have got some profit, in consequence of the
illegal acts of the defendant, were liable to be proceeded against before
a body of ‘judices ;’ they came under the general terms ‘ quo ea pecunia
quam is ceperit qui damnatus sit pervenerit? The condemnation of a
third person, however, relieved the defendant from payment of damages.
It is generally said that the Lex Cornelia of the Dictator Sulla raised
the Litis Aestimatio to quadruple the amount of the real damage. But
there is no direct evidence for this. This Lex retained the chapter
‘ Quo pervenerit,’ as we see from the oration Pro Cluentio, c. 41, which
was delivered when the Lex Cornelia was in force. The last Lex de
Repetundis was the Lex Julia, passed in Caesar's first consulship.

It appears that all the Leges de Repetundis applied only to abuse of
their office by Magistratus 3 but the principle of these Leges was extended
to the acts of private personS, which were of a like character with those
acts that came within the provisions of those Leges de Repetundis. To
this class of private actions, formed in imitation of the proceedings under
the Leges de Repetundis‚ belong the ‘in factum actio,⁷ on the ground
of ‘calumnia’ ³ (Dig. 3. 6. 1), and the ‘ Actio quod metus causa-,² which we

are now considering.

2 Ι don't understand this. 11· a man pleaded guilty, that was as good as if he was
found guilty. But, if he was acquitted on the charge of Repetundae, Ι don’t sec how
hc could be liable to pay any thing in respect ofia charge which had not boen proved.

³ “ Iu euni qui, ut calumniae causa negotium faceret vel non faceret, pecuniam acce-
pisse dicetur, intra annum in quadruplum ejus pecuniae quam accepisse dicetur, post
annum simpli in factum actio competit.''
