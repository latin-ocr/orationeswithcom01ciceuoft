Tum illa, ut mos in Sicilia est

praefecto illi religionem Veneris nomenque objiceret, dixit et se et

szereormnfl ‘Veneriorum,' Iordan.
We may infer from ‘liberaverunt’ that
these slaves sometimes got their liberty by
paying the price of their value, or in some
other way.—‘110111e11que :' ‘nomine,' Ior-
dan. The word ‘religionem' means an
answer to the claim of the praefectus,
which was founded 011 the relation of the
slaves to their former mistress, who after
their manumission would be their ‘pa-
trona? See note on ‘ Veneris esse?

VENERIS ESSE] A deity was considered
as a person, like a human person, and
accordingly 116 could possess property. It
was an easy transition to consider the deity
who was worshipped in any particular
temple as having the character of an
artificial person, or what we eall very
absurdly a corporation, and still more
abmrdly, when the artificial person is a
611111611, we call it a corporation sole. It is
the characteristic of all artificia] persons to
have the capacity to hold property and to
be represented by real persons3 and indeed
this capacity is the essence of the notion of
an artificia] person. (Dig. 3. 4. 1. ξ 1.)
Under the later Roman system it was not
permitted for a man to make gods his
heredes, that is, he could not bequcath his
property to a temple, except such gods as
some senatusconsultum or imperial con-
stitution allowed a man to leave his pro-
perty to. (Ulpian, Fr. xxii. ξ 6.) Τ1115 11116
of law, mentioned by Ulpian, was perhaps
not a rule of law which allowed in some
cases what had previously been forbidden
in all cases ; but it seems more likely that it
was a rule of law which limited the capacity
of testators to give and ofreligious bodies to
take by testament. It is curicus to trace
the adaptation of Roman notions to Chris-
tian institutions, of the corporate character
of a Roman temple to a Christian church.
All this is well explained by Savigny
(System, &c. vol. ii. Iuristische Personen).

As soon as Caecilius was informed of
the statement of Agonis, he appointed
a judicial inquii-y, that 15, 116 named
judices (judicium dat) to inquire about
the fact, ‘si parct,' if it should appear

EAM SE ET SVA VENERIS ESSE

Judicant recuperatores id quod necesse erat ; neque enim

that Agonis had said so. ‘ Si paret ²
refers to that part of the formula called the
‘intentio,' that is, that part of the formal
instructions which the magistrate gave to
the ⁶ judices? in which part the claim of a
plaintiff was expressed. But in some cases,
as in this of Agonis, the ‘judex’ was not
required to examine whether a certain thing
belonged to the plaintiff, or a certain de-
mand was due from the defendant3 but he
had simply tc ascertain a fact, and there-
upon to condemn or absolve. In such a
case the formula was said to be ‘in factum
concepta ς’ and it was in this shapessfl J 11-
dex esto: si paret A. A. apud N. N. men-
sam argenteam deposuisse eamque dolo
malo Numerii Negidii Aulo Agerio reddi-
tam non esse, quanti ea res erit tantam pe-
cuniam N. N. Ao Ao condemnato.’' The
passages which explain this matter are
Gaius, iv. 45—47. Klotz and Zumpt read
‘ si paret,’ which is the true legal formula.
‘ Paret,' being misunderstood by the copy-
istS, was corrupted. The old editions have
‘ pateret? ‘ Pareret ³ is a correction of
Lambinus. Orelli has ‘ pareret.’
recuperatores] The ‘ recuperatores ³ be-
longed to the ‘judices privati? It is said
that ‘ recuperatores ³ were originally ap-
pointed in cases of dispute between Romans
and Peregrini, and were appointed for each
occasion as it arose. But this distinction
disappeared in course of time, for we read
of ‘ recuperatores’ in cases where Roman
citizens only were concerned, and of ‘ju-
dices’ 111 cases where Peregrini only were
concerncd. After the Lex Aebutia, of un-
certain date, the ‘judices' generally were
called either ‘judiees' 01· ⁶ recuperatores ,·'
and as to the ‘ recuperatores,’ properly so
called, we collect froin various passages
that they were appointed in certain par·
ticular cases. In the later period, at least
in the time of Gaius, there was generally
only one ‘ judex’ appointed, but the ‘ recu-
peratores ' were always several, sometimes
three (Act. ii. Lib. 3. c. 12) 3 and thus
Gaius (iv. 105) opposes the ‘ recuperatoria
judicia' to those ‘ sub uno judice? Much
has been written on the ‘ recuperatores‚'
