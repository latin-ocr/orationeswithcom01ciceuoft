suarum rerum gestarum quum ‘maxime constituat atque in iis
- elaboret, profecto volet haec non solum suis posteris verum etiam
⁷ omnibus Viris fortibus et bonis civibus defendenda non spolianda
improbis tradere. N on Vereor ne tibi, Q. Catule, displiceat, eujus
amplissimum in orbe terrarum clarissimumque monumentum est,
quam plurimos esse custodes monumentorum et putare omnes bonos
alienae gloriae defensionem ad officium suum pertinere. Equidem
ceteris istius furtis atque flagitiis ita moveor ut ea reprehendenda
tantum putem: hic vero tanto dolore afficior ut nihil mihi indigpius,
nihil minus ferendum esse videatur. Verres Africani monumentis
domum suam, plenam stupri, plenam flagitii, plenam dedecoris,

quum maxime] Zumpt and not ‘adverbialiter’ with ‘maxime’
The use of ‘quum,' and ‘quum’ and

38. suarum . . .
says that it ought to be ‘rerum suaru1n‚’

δια, and Ernesti adopted this order, though
there is no MS. authority for it. The pro-
nouns, ‘meus,' ‘ tuus‚’ may either stand
before their noun or after; and the place
of ‘meus‚' ‘tuus‚' &c., is determined by
the sense.

‘ Quum maxime,’ or ‘ eummaxime,' as
Zumpt has it, is a genuine form ς nor is it
necessary to erase ‘ quum,' or to write with
G 1 ‘ quam maxime.' ‘ Quuininaxiine,’
says Zumpt, when used adverbially, marks
either present time, or time indefinitely3
and when it particularly signifies present
time, it requires the addition of ‘nunc‚'
as ‘ nunc quum maxime ι’ as to time past,
we say ‘tum maxime.’ He refers to Dra-
kenborch, Liv. xxvii. 4, and particularly
to the learned note of Duker on Florus ii.
16. 3 (ed. 1711-4), which is worth reading.
Some of the editors have heen disposed to
get rid of the form ‘tum maxime‚’ and
change it into ‘quum maxime? hut the
distinction between them seems clear.

In Cicero (Ad l)iv. ix. 23) there is “ex-
pecta igitur hospitem quum minime eda-
cem tum inimicum coenis sumptuosis.'¹
But here the form of the sentence is ‹lif-
felent, for‘ quum’ is f ›llowed hy ‘tuuis
and this passage cannot he eompxired with
that ιιι the text. In 'leienee‚ Phormio, ii.
3.11‚ther'e is—

“Quamobrem onmes quum secundae res
sunt maxime. tum maxime.
Meditari secum oportet,'' &Q

where. ‘'tum malks the time already ex-
pressed hy‘ quum) 1 see no resa ·on uhy
the‘ qumn’ in this passage of C· icero shoul'd
not be taken in the same sense as tho

‘quum' in‘ quum ies maximas gesserit‚'

‘ tum,’ still waits for fuller explanation.

elaboret‚] ‘laboret’ (1¹13 Lg. 29. The
distinction between the two words is gene-
rally observed. Zumpt says that ‘ laborare
ob aliquam rem ³ is ‘laborem liabere‚’ ‘ to
be troubled, perplexed,' and so forth. But
there are instances of ‘laborare ³ followed
by ‘ ut‚' where it is used like ‘ elaborare 3'
and Zumpt has in his edition one instance,
at least (Lib. 3. c. 56), “ atque in hoc labo-
randum ut omnes intelligant :'' but the
true reading there is probably ‘ elaboran-
dum? In Lib. 3. c. 57, “sedasti etiam
lites illorum, et sponsio illa ne lieret labo-
rasti.”

in orbe] ‘ orbi ³ R 3 Iordan, ‘ in orbe ‘
dett. Or. Halm observes that Charisius
contii-ms the use of the ablative form ‘orbi'
in Cicero, and adds “frequenter antiquos
ita locutos Plinius eodem libro vi. notat.''
Ι do not doubt that forms like ‘orbi ' were
used, hut they mean ‘ in a plat-ef and
‘orbi terrarum' does not seem a proper
example. ln this chapter 1 should have
written ‘ Karthagini eaptum,' if any MSS.
authority were eited sor ⁴ Karthagini: sor
l ‹lo not explain it as lIalm does, ‘taken
from Carthage,’ nor is it the same as ‘ Kar-
thagine. tollere.'

Equidem] The reading of the ohl edi-
tions, and of the dett. is ‘ et quidem)
The best MSS. have ‘eqnidem,' and the
sense requires it. Drakenboreh (Liv. vi.
51.) shows how frequently the two ἴοι-ωε
ure eonfounded, even in good MSS.

{enipe’1·anlis.=·inn'] R, ‘ temlwraiissimi '
G 3 lagg. In the Pro Fonteio, e. 17, there
is ‘homo sanctissimus ae temperantissi-
mus) The Romans perhaps used both

‘temperantissimus’ aud ‘temperatissimus?
