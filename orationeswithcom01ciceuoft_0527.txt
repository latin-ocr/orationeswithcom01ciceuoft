AOT. II. LIBER QUARTUS. 509

pulcherrimam omnium, saepe audistis. Est, judices, ita ut dicitur.
Nam et situ est quum munito, tum ex omni aditu vel terra vel
mari praeclaro ad aspectum: et portus habet prope in aedificatione
aspectuque urbis inclusos, qui quum diversos inter se aditus
habeant, in exitu conjunguntur et confluunt. Eorum conjunctione
pars oppidi, quae appellatur Insula, mari disjuncta angusto, ponte
rursus adjungitur et continetur.

LIII. Ea tanta est urbs ut ex quatuor urbibus maximis constare
dicatur ε quarum una est ea quam dixi Insula, quae duobus portu-
bus cincta in utriusque portus ostium aditumque projecta est ; in
qua domus est quae Hieronis regis fuit, qua praetores uti solent.
In ea sunt aedes sacrae complures, sed duae quae longe ceteris
antecellunt, una Dianae, et altera, quae fuit ante istius adventum
ornatissima, Minervae. In hac insula extrema est fons aquae
dulcis, cui nomen Arethusa est, incredibili magnitudine, plenissi-

topography of the place has nothing to do
with Cicero’s case, and the passage may be
considered merely an embellishment.

The common reading is ‘pulcherrimam-
que,’ which, as Zumpt observes, would
limit the superiority of Syracuse in beauty
to the Greek cities. But, if Syracuse was
the finest of Greek cities‚ we may suppose
that it was the finest of all cities then exist-
ing. Rome certainly, in Cicero's time, could
not be compared with it. However, there
is good authority for omitting the ‘que,’
and the remark will then be general, as it is
at the beginning of e. 52. Hotmann thought
that‘Graecarumurbium’oughttobeplaced‚
111 c. 52, between the words ‘ omnium ' and
‘ pulcheri·i111ae.’ Zumpt settles the matter
by a quotation from the De Re Publica,
iii. 31 z “ Urbs illa praeclara, quam ait
Timaeus Graecarum maximam, omnium
autem esse pulcherrimam.''

esc omni aditu] ‘on whatever side you
approach! See Cacsar, 13. G. ii. 29, ‘ex
omnibus in circuitu partibus)

53. Insula,] 'l'hc island is Ortygia, the
original city. Cicero speaks of the two
ports, the larger 111111 the. smaller, which
may be considered as united in the more
remote part (exitu) from the sca by the
narrow channcl which separated the island
from the main 1111111. 111 the time of'Phuey-
didos the island was united to the main land
by a mole. Aftcrwards= 1110 1111110 was cut
through, and 11 bridge was thrown across;
aud so it was when Strabo saw it (p. 270,
ed. Casu). 'l‘he channel was again filled up,
and modern Syracuse stands on the island
and on the isthmus,

quae . . . antecellunffi] Zumpt, Klotz,
and Iordan have ‘ antecellant.' Zumpt re-
marks on ‘antecellant :³ “sie prorsus Erfurt.

Vulgo antecellunt? If Cicero means to
say that these two tcmplcs surpassed all
others, there is 110 other way ol= expressing
it except by thc indicative. The remark
of Zumpt seems to me founded (111 11 00111-
