“NON MODO‚'’ &o 649

“ nunc non modo te hoc crimine non arguo, sed ne illa quidem communi

vituperatione reprehendo.” Here each clause has its predicate, and if
¹ the ‘ non ' before ‘ arguo ' were omitted, the meaning would be so far
just the opposite of what is intended.

If the predicate occurs in the first part of the sentence, and a nega-
tion is intended, the ‘non ' is necessary, though ⁴ ne . . quidem ' eomes
after (Lib. 3. c. 97) ε “non solum aestimandi frumenti modus non fuit
sed ne imperandi quidem ⁴.'’

There are many cases in which ‘ non modo non ’ occurs, but the reader
must learn to distinguish them from the supposed case of ‘ non modo ’
being used sor ‘non modo non.’ In Divin. c 9, “ M. Caecilium . . non
modo non adesse neque tecum tuas injurias persequi, sed esse cum
Verre,'' where it is plain that the second ‘ non ' qualifies ‘ adesse.' The
assertionis not limited to a ‘non adesse’ at the trial, and a ‘neque
persequi’ of Verres: it goes so far as to affirm an ‘esse cum Ver1·e.’
In the following instance (Divin. c. 11), ‘⁴ facile omnes intelligent vobis
inter vos non modo voluntatem fuisse conjunctam, sed ne praedam
quidem adhuc esse divisam,” a ‘ non ’ before ‘ conjunctam ’ would nega-
tive what Cicero affirms in that clause, ‘that there was union of will,
and that was not al].' In Lib. 1. c. 15, the true reading is “ non modo
non exsistit verum etiam opprimit antequam prospicere . . potueris,’'
which passage some of the critics would corrupt by omitting the ‘ non’
before ‘ exsistit ;’ and thus they would make Cicero write nonsense.

‘¹ Compare the instance in Cic. Ad Attio. i. 11.
