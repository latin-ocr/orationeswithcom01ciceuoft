creati sint operae pretium est cognoscere. Ille enim est magis-
tratus apud Siculos qui diligentissime mandatur a populo propter
hano causam, quod omnes Siculi ex censu quotannis tributa con—
ferunt: in censu habendo potestas omnis aestimationis habendae
summaeque faciendae censori permittitur. Itaque et populus cui
maximam fidem suarum rerum habeat maxima cura deligit; et
propter magnitudinem potestatis hic magistratus a populo summa
ambitione contenditur. In ea re iste nihil obscure facere voluit,
non in sortitione fallere neque dies de fastis eximere: nihil sane
vafre nec malitiose facere conatus est: sed, ut studia cupiditates-
que honorum atque ambitiones ex omnibus civitatibus tolleren-
tur, quae res evertendae rei publicae solent esse, ostendit sese
in omnibus civitatibus censores esse facturum. Tanto mercatu
praetoris indicto concurritur undique ad istum Syracusas. Fla-

rogative, as ‘m Lib. 5. c. 47, and other
passages, We might then write ‘ J am vero
censores διο. creati sunt P Operae pretium
est cognoscere-³

These ‘ censores ' were provincial ‘magis-
tracus: appointed by the provincials them-
selves (c. 55). They made a census or
rating for the taxation of the towns for
municipal purposes, and not for the pur·
pose of giving the produce of the taxes to
the Romans. Thc Romans took for them-
selves the ‘vectigalia,' which consisted of
the Decumae, Portorium, and Scriptura.
This tax for provincial purposes is called
here ‘tributunn’

mandatur] ‘Mandare’ is a word that
signities the entrusting of something to
another to perform, with the addition of
the proper authority. Accordineg ‘man-
datum ' is that Roman conti-act which ex-
presses the. relation of principal or person
empowering and agent or person empower·
ed, but the person empowered (mamlatarius)
acte-d gratuitously. The word was therefore
applieable enough to the couferring of au
office by the people, an office of honour
and duties, but ot' no emolument. Horace
uses the word in the same sense as Cicero
(1 Sat. vi. 18) :

“ Namque esto, populus Laevino mallet
honorem
Quam Decio mandare novo ;’'

and Liv. iv. 3. The old reading, ‘cui man-
(latur,' needs no refutation, though it is
the reading of most of the codd. Lg. 29
42 have ‘ qui.’

aestimationis habendae effa] This refers
to the censor’s rating of each person accord—
ing to the estimate of his property, and to
his fming the amount that each had to pay
(summae faciendae), as Manutius explains
it. As to the expression ‘ eui maximam
fidem suarum rerum habeat,' Zumpt is ae-
quainted with one other instance, which is
Plautus, Persa, v. 2. 8, “ Quia ei tidem non
habui argenti, eo mihi eas machinas molitu
'st ;'’ but Creuzer and Moser add another
from Caesar, Bell. Gall. i. 19. Compare
also B. G. vi. 23, “omniumque iis rerum
postea tides derogaturss’

omnibus viz-ilalibus]
tibusque' Lg. 42 p. m. and Zumpt. 1 now
think that the common reading, which
Iordan has, ought to he retained.

evertendae rei publicae] A few MSS.
add ‘ eausa,’ which is the addition of a
copyist. Zumpt refers to Cort's Sallust,
Cat. c. 6, for this use, which does not occur
elsewhere in Cicero, as Zumpt observes.
He takes the words to be in the genitive.
Garatoni takes them for the dative. Ιιι
the passage os Sallust the genitive is eer-
taiuly used, if ‘libertatis ' is right. Ιιι
Sall. Cat. 46 ‘perdundae rei publicae sore ’
might be the dative.

solent θεας] “postulatur ‘solerent esse,'
quippe illo praetextu utebatur Verres 3
alienissimo loco suam sententiam posuisset
orator '’ (Bake, quoted hy Halm). 1 do
not agree with the remark ‘alienissimo
loeo' Sc„ but the learned eritie has eor-
reetly explained the diss'erenee between
‘solerent ' and ‘ solent ’ in this passage.
