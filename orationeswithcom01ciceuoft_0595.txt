AOT. II. LIBER QUINTUS. 577

XXXI. Hac tanta praeda auctus, mancipiis, argento, veste locu-
pletatus, nihilo diligentior ad classem ornandam, milites revocandos
. alendosque esse coepit, quum ea res non solum provinciae saluti
verum etiam ipsi praedae posset esse. Nam aestate summa, quo
tempore ceteri praetores obire provinciam et concursare consue-
runt, aut etiam in tanto praedonum metu et periculo ipsi navigare,
eo tempore ad luxuriem libidinesque suas domo sua regia, quae
regis Hieronis fuit, qua praetores uti solent, contentus non fuit:
tabernacula, quemadmodum consuerat temporibus aestivis, quod
antea demonstravi, carbaseis intenta velis collocari jussit in littore,
quod est littus in Insula Syracusis post Arethusae fontem, propter
ipsum introitum atque ostium portus, amoeno sane et ab arbitris
remoto loco. Hic dies aestivos praetor populi Romani, custos
defensorque provinciae, sic vixit ut muliebria quotidie convivia
essent, Vir accumberet nemo praeter ipsum et praetextatum filium 3
tametsi recte sine exceptione dixeram virum quum isti essent
neminem fuisse: nonnunquam etiam libertus Timarchides adhi-
bebatur ; mulieres autem nuptae nobiles praeter unam mimi Isidori

of this piratical captain. This is a sample
of the idle way of talking about things
which in no way concern the explanation
of the text. Ι would not have it supposed
that I believe all that Cicero says. I am
very ready to disbclieve him often. But
when we know no more of a thing than
what Cicero tells us, we must take it as he
tells it, and sce whether it is for bis ease
or against bim. The Roman orator is a
match for any number of eommentators iu
handling his matter. Klotz approves ot
Zumpt’s remark. He knows more than he
is told by his author.

31. concursare] Cicero uses this word
to express being active aud busy, as iu
c. 123 and so be uses ‘ concurrere ’ 111 l'ro
Quint. e. 16, as Graevius remarks. ln
c. 35, ‘concursabat . . multitudo' is not
the meeting of the multitude, but the run-
ning to and fro of all the persons. So
Caesar (13. (i. i. 47) says ‘ Ariovistus . . .
conclamavit :' and Cic. In Cat. iv. 8,
‘ lenonem quendam . . . concursare circum
tabernas!

qnae reglis Sne] These words have oc-
curred before, see Lib. 4. e. 533 but this is
not a sufficient reason for supposing that
they are not the genuine words of Cicero
here. Klotz observes that each of these
books is complete in itself, and that they
were at first published separately, though
he does not state the evidence for this, It

vol.. 1.

is however common for a man to repeat
the same expression when he is speaking a
second time of the sanie thing, and to do it
without thinking of what he has said bc-
fore. Klotz refers to what Cicero says of
Thespiae (Lib. 4. c. 2 aud 60); and he
also compares Lib. 2. c. 8, and Lib. 5.
c. 41.

contentus] ‘ contemptus ' R.

arbitris] ‘ Iu a pleasant spot, and one
safe against all intruders ;' visitors, coniers.
For ‘ arbiter ' is one who comes 10 11 1111100,
from ‘ar ' (ad), and the root ‘ bit,' to
‘ come ' or ‘ go)

{amm-i] Zumpt aud lordau read ‘etsi,'
following R 3 λ. Zumpt says. though
‘quamquam ' is the proper word when a
man is thus (Ὧι-10011011Γ what he has said,
yet ‘tametsi’ and ‘etsi ·’ 01111 110 used sor
it. If so, we gaiu nothing hy this altera-
tion. In Lib. 1·. c. 2 there is ‘ tametsi de
absolutione,' which is Zumpt's reading3
aud 110 says iu his note. ‘ (luelll'. etsi, quod
non sane contemno) Here 110 prefers 11.
‘'I'ametsi' is very generally followed by
⁸ tamen ' in these orations. But it* we take
the cases where a word of this meaning
stands at tho beginning of a sentence, and
is not followed by ‘tamem' we find that
‘ tametsi’ is the usual word, and not ⁴ etsi:
in these orations. In e. 34 there is ⁸ etsi
iu hac quadriremi) Here V (111.) dett.
have ‘ tanietsi,'
