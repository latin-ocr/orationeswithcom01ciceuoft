SICILY A ROMAN PROVINCE. 635

speaking of the order made by the Centuripini (Lib. 2. c. 67) for the
demolition of the statues of Verres, says “ Centuripinorum senatus

’ decrevit populusque jussit.’' But even in Cicero's time it appears that

the Sieilian towns applied to the Roman senate about their internal
administration, if a great difficulty arose. In Be. 95 the Halesini could
not agree among themselves about the mode of filling up vacancies in
their senate, and they addressed themselves to the senate at Rome. The
senate empowered C. Claudius Pulcher to draw up for them a code of
rules (leges dare, conscribere) as to the qualifications and the election
of senators, which he did with the assistance of all the BIarcelh, whom
he invited to aid him in this matter (Lib. 2. c. 49). The Romans did
not touch the constitution of the Sicilian towns, or,if they did make any
alterations, such a practice was the exception and not the rule. The
Sicilian towns retained their senate, their chief magistrate, one or more,
the various public functionaries, and their priestly offices. The temples
retained their property, as we see in the case of Eryx3 and the high
priesthood of the temple of Jupiter at Syracuse (Lib. 2. c. 51), an
honourable, and probably a lucrative office, gave the citizens annually
the excitement of an election, like the Roman ‘comitia' (Lib. 2. 6. 51,
52). Many of these Sicilian temples had large possessions, which were
increased by the gifts of pious persons. They could also take gists by
testament, either directly or by virtue of a resolutive condition (Lib. 2.
6. 8), or a penalty. Several of the rich temples of Sicily are mentioned
by Cicero.

In addition to the property which some at least of the Sicilian towns
possessed, they must have required taxes to defray the expenses of the
local administration. These taxes (tributa) were levicd upon the ratcd
value of property, and the assessment was made every fifth year. Each
‘ civitas= elected two ‘ censores ’ by popular vote, and the office, which
we should consider somewhat an invidious one, was an object of great
competition ‘ propter magnitudinem potcstatis‚’ as Cicero says (Lib. 2.
0. 53); but there was probably some pccuniary advantage derived from
it, indireetly perhaps, or we can hardly understand why the candidates
paid money to Verres for the office, when 116 illegally intcrfcrcd in the
elections. On this occasion at least, according to the orator, the censors
abused the office which they had scandalously got; for they made an
unfair ratiug, and threw the burden on the poorer sort. The number
'of ‘civitates’ which had consors during the administration of Verres
was sixty-five, for the whole number of ccnsors appointed by Verres
was a hundred and thirty. The towns could also take property nndcra
testament. The legal notion of an artificial person, aa these town com-
munities were for tho purpose of holding property, which is indeed tho
only purpose sor which this fiction exists, was fully developed iu Sicily,
