15 subject to the payment of tenths (decu-
mae), yet so that the old mode of admi-
nistration is maintained in conformity to
the Lex Hieronica (that 15, 50 that the
tenths were let separately 111 Sicily, and
generally let to those who were bound
to pay them, and 011 easy ternis). But
without any respect to these differences
Cicero calls all land 111 the provinces by
the general name of ‘agri vectigales,'
which consequently was at that time the
general name for all land that paid a tax ‚-
and it is this liability to taxation which he
always considers as the general character
of all the provinces, so that only particular
towns were exempt from it” (Savigny,
Vcrmischte Schriften, Riimische Steuer-
verfassung, ii. 97). But we must under-
stand that the ‘ perpaucae civitates,' whose
land became ‘publicus Populi Romani,5
did not recover the ownership of the land.
(See the next note.) In the time of Gaius
it was the legal doctrine that the ‘ domi-
nium ³ 01· ownership of all provincial land
was either in the Roman people 01· in the
Caesar (ii. 7): “in provinciali solo . . do-
minium populi Romani est vel Caesaris,
nos autem possessionem tantum et usum-
fructum habere videmur.”

Zumpt attempts to ascertain the number
of these ‘perpaucae civitates? but if 1115
interpretation of this passage is not true,
his attempt is a failnre.

publicus populi Romam· 15⁶²] The
following is one interpretation of this pas-
sage. These states being conquered by
the Romans, their land, according to the
rule of war, became the property of the
Roman people‚ but it was restored to these
states. They paid a ‘ vectigal,' which was
. let at Rome by the censors5 and in this
respect the occupiers of ‘ager redditus'
were on the same footing as the inha-
bitants of those Punic towns which paid
tenths of grain, wine, and oil. For when
Cicero says ‘is ager—locari solet,' he means
that the tenths were let, not the land
itself. Still these least favoured Sicilian

towns, whose tithes were let at Rome by
the censors to the ‘ publicani,’ were on the
footing of the more favoured Punic towns
which were directly subject to the ‘impe-
rium ' of the Proconsul of Africa ς for the
other Punic towns, which were under the
Proconsul, lost a part of their land, which
was made Publicus Populi Romani, and
for the rest, which was restored to them,
they paid a fixed tax, ‘stipendium' or
‘vectigal stipendiarium.' They also paid
a capitation-tax both for males and females
(Appian, Pun. c. 135). This will explain
Cicero’s expression ‘plerisque Poenorum?
Several of the Punic towns, which had
sided with the Romans, received a portion
of the conquered land, and were ‘liberae
et immune& that 15, like those Sicilian
towns which Cicero mentions. They were
not immediately under the governor’s
(See Rudorff, Zeitschrift fiir
Geschichtl. Rechtsw. Das Ackergesetz des
Sp. Thorius, vol. x.)

There 15 still difficulty in this pas-
sage. Becker (Handbuch, iii. 1, p. 42)
maintains that this land, which Cicero
calls ¹ redditus: was let to the Sici-
lians3 that the ‘locatio' does not apply
to the tenths, but that it means a lease
of the land itself for certain payments.
He observes that the Ager Leontinus
was ‘ ager publicus populi Romani‚’
and Leontini was therefore one of these
few states (Cic. Phil. ’it-17. 393 iii. 9).
Now Cicero says that the lands of these
conquered states had been restored 3 but
in Verres’ time not a single Leontine except
one family occupied any land 111 the Ager
Leontinus. The land was, Cicero says, let
to eighty-four farmers (aratores), some
Sicilians, and others Romans. (Lib. 3. c.
51,- and c. 18. 24. 41). Becker concludes
from the words ‘ paternas arationes ’ (Lib.
3. c. 41), that the leases were transmissible
by succession (vererblich) ; but I have
some doubt whether he knew exactly what
he meant when he wrote this. If the
lease was for a. certain number of yearS,
