514 IN O. VERREM

ornare arbitrentur3 quod tamen nemo suspicari debet tam esse
me cupidum ut tot viros primarios velim, praesertim ex judicum
numero qui Syracusis fuerint, qui haec viderint, esse temeritati et
mendacio meo conscios. Confirmare hoc liquido, judices, possum,
valvas magnificentiores, ex auro atque ebore perfectiores, nullas
unquam ullo [in] templo fuisse. Incredibile dictu est quam multi
Graeci de harum valvarum pulchritudine scriptum reliquerint.
Nimium forsitan haec illi mirentur atque efferant: est0; verum-
tamen honestius est rei publicae nostrae, judices, ea quae illis
pulchra esse videantur imperatorem nostrum in bello reliquisse
quam praetorem in pace abstulisse. Ex ebore diligentissime per-
fecta argumenta erant in valvis: ea detrahenda curavit omnia.

cupidum] This word means eager or
passionate in any matter. Zumpt com-
pares the expression ‘ cupidi testes ' in the
oration Pro Flacco, c. 8. Gruter refers to
the Pro Caecina, c. 3. See also Phil. vi.

that many had written about these doors,
and yet he does not mention the names of
the artists. The ‘ argumenta ³ or ‘ sub-
jects ³ were in gold and ivory. ‘ Argu-
mentum ' in this-sense occurs in Lib. 2. c. 37.

6. Graevius says of Lambinus, who started
a difficulty about ‘cupidum,' ‘hallucina-
tur ;’ he quotes Cicero, Pro Fonteio, c. 6:
‘⁵ Potest igitur testibus judex non credere Ρ
Cupidis et iratis . . . non solum potest, sed
etiam debet.'’ Again, in a letter to Tiro
(Ad Div. xvi. 11), “ Nos agimus nihil
cupide.” In Lib. 3. c. 61, we have the
phrase ‘ praetor cupidus existimationis
bonae? Poor Lambinus is overwhelmed
with evidence against his hallucination.

‘Quod tamen nemo‚' &c. Cicero very
frequently uses ‘id,' ‘illud,' ‘hoc,' with
reference to something that he is going to
say. He uses ‘quod’ just in the same
way, ‘quod’ being in fact a demonstrative
in its original. No person can take ‘ quod’
for what they call a conjunction here.
‘Tamen' forbids that. Examples of this
form of expression are common.

valva-s* . . auro cisen] ‘Valvae ' are doors
which open inwards, as Garatoni explains
by reference to Isidorus, xiii. 7 ; and
‘fores' are those which open outwards
(foras). Ι (10 not take this to be a true
explanation.

A doorway and a door are things on
which an architect can show his taste‚ and
an artist his skill. Some of the great
works of art, both of ancient and modern
timeffi are doors and gates. Cicero says

The word is used in the same sense by

Virgil, Aen. vii. 791, where he describes
the armour of Turnus :—

“ Argumentum ingens et custos virginis
Argus. ³

Servius, in his note on this passage of Vir-
gil, quotes this passage of Cicero.

The palace of the sun had a splendid
door of the same kind, Ovid, Met. ii. 4 :—

“ Argenti bifores radiabant lumine valvae.
Materiem superabat opus : nani Mulciber
Aeilliigra caelarat medias cingentia terras.

Signaque sex foribus dextris, totidemque
sinistris.”

But here Ovid calls the two parts of the
doors ‘ fores.’v

bullas] The heads of the nails, or fas-
tenings, as Hotmann supposes, so called
because they were like ‘bullae' (see Lib.
2. c. 58, note). He refers to a passage in
the Asinaria of Plautus, ii. 4. 20:

“ J ussin’ in splendorem dari bullas has
foribus nostris.'’

There is a medal of Nero, on the reverse
of which is the door of the temple of J anus,
as we may conclude from the legend :—
PACE · PR · TERRA · MARIQ · PARTA · IANVM·
CLVSIT. The door is divided into six
panels by a vertical band in the middle, and
