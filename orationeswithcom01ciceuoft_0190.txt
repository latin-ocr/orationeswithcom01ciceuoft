ΠΙ. LEX VOCONIA.

THE Lex Voconia has been the subject of many dissertatione, and of
many contradictory opinions. The scanty notices of it in the Roman
writers make the investigation difficult3 but the difference of opinion
has mainly arisen from the fact that many critics have been more disposed
to make guesses than to accept and examine evidence. The substance
of what follows is contained in Savigny’s Essay on the Lex Voconia
(Ver-mischte Schriften, i. 407, Sco).

Savigny contends that the Lex was prepared and carried by the
Tribunus Plebis, Q. Voconia Saxa, in Rc. 169, in the consulship of
Q. Marcius Philippus and Cn. Servilius Caepio (Cic. De Sen. c. 5). The
first and prineipal provision of the Lex waS, that no woman should be
instituted ‘heres ’ by a testament, if the testator was registered in the
census as having a property of 100‚000 Sestertii (Cio. In Verr. Actsi.v
Lib. 1. c. 423 Gaius, ii. 274). According to these passages, which are
confirmed by Asconius (In Verr. Lib. 1. 41), and Augustinus (de
Civitate Dei, iii. c. 21), no person could make a woman his ‘heres‚’
either sole ‘hex-es: or ‘heres’ as to any part of his property ¹. The
prohibition, however, did not extend to all testators, but only to those
whose property was of the value of 100‚000 Sestertii, as we learn from
Asconius, whose testimony agrees with that of Dion Cassius (56, e. 10),
who fixes the amount at 25‚OOO Drachmae, by which he means, as
usual, Denarii3 and this sum is equivalent to 100,000 Sestertii. In the
passage of Gaius, the amount of the property is expressed thus : “item
mulier quae ab eo qui centum milia aeris census est per legem Voconiam
heres institui non potest.'’ In this passage ‘ aes ’ does not mean Asses,
but Sestertii, as Savigny oontends3 and perhaps heis right. If Gaius
means Asses, the amount of the property which was within the pro-
vision of the Lex would be 25,000 Sestertii, for at the time of the
enactment of the Lex the Sestertius was equivalent to four of the
