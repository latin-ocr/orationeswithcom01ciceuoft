cum octavo bene ut agatur3 verum ut omnes dii adjuvent, cum
decumo: quod si quando accidit, tum fit ut tantum decumae sit
quantum severis, hoc est, ut quot jugera sint sata totidem medimna
decumae debeantur. Hoc quum ita esset, primum illud dieo, pluribus
millibus medimnum venisse decumas agri Leontini quam quot millia
jugerum sata essent 111 agro Leontino. Quodsi fieri non poterat ut
plus quam decem medimna ex jugero exararent, medimnum autem
ex jugero decumano dari oportebat, quum ager, id quod perraro
evenit, cum decumo extulisset, quae erat ratio decumanis, si quidem
decumae ac non bona venibant aratorum, ut pluribus aliquanto
medimnis decumas emerent quam jugera erant sata? In Leontino

XLVIII. Decumae xxxvi medimnum venierunt. Erravit aut
potius insanivit Apronius? Immo tum insanisset, si aratoribus id
quod deberent licitum esset, et non quod Apronius imperasset
necesse fuisset dare. Si ostendam minus tribus medimnis in juge-
rum neminem dedisse decumae, concedes, opinor, ut cum decumo
fructus arationis perceptus sit, neminem minus tribus decumis

 

duce of eight medimna the land does well ς
but a produce of ten is an especial favour
of heaven! shortly after occurs the ex-
pression ‘ curn decumo extulisset.’ In the
next chapter, “ ut cum decumo fructus
arationis perceptus sit,” ‘the crop got in
with ten for one? The expression of Co-
lumella is the same ε “ nani frumenta ma-
jore quidem parte Italiae quando cum
quarto responderint vix meminisse possu-
mus '' (iii. 3).

dari opot·lebat‚] The true reading, fur-
nis-hed by Lg. 42, may be notieed, as
Orelli has ‘poterat,’ which is obviously a
blunder that has arisen from the proximity

of the other ‘ poterat.’

venibant] The MSS. are not consistent
in this form, for Zumpt observes that both
here, and in 0. 50, all have ‘veniebantff
But it is now generally agreed that ‘ veni-
bant ' is the form for which there is best
authority.

subscriptio cie] Lg. 42 has ‘ sub-
scriptio professio,' which is speeious, but
probably not true. The ‹nnis-sion of the
‘et' in formulary languago has been re-
marked 011 above, 0. :3o.—1n 1111100 of ‘plus
ἷίῖῑίξ Klotz has ‘plus xxx nliliu1n,’ which
is the same thing.

48. Deeumae i'x—i'v‘i] Cieero states his
case clearly. There were 3o,ooo ‘jugera ’
returned as sown with corn. This was
the ‘professio ' or return, which return the

‘aratores ’ were obliged to make : “jugera
professi sunt aratores imperio atque insti-
tuto tuo.’' The ‘subscriptio ’ probably
means the signature to the return, which
sig-nature shows by whom it was made, as
a man signs his return to the Income Tax.
The produce of the ε(100111111ιο ’ eould not,
in the most favourable seasons, be more
than ’λῇς but Apronius bought the ‘ de-
cumae ' for jx‘xxvn. He would therefore
lose 171 at least by his bargain, if the
people had paid no more than what was
due. llowever, Apronius made his bargain
profitable, for he allowed poor people, as a.
special favour, to eompound (decidere). by
paying three ‘ medimna’ for each ‘jugerum ;’
so that, if thc- produee was ten ‘medinma,’
they paid three ‘decumam’ three-tenths, in
place ot'one. Is it was less, so mueh the
worse for them, as they paid three ‘ medim-
na' out of a smaller amount. But eren this,
as it appears, was not the worst. for this
rasead claimed as machus five ‘medimna ’
for eaeh ‘juge1·u1u.’

‘ Ut emn det-amo . . perceptus sit ’ means
as above explained, ‘ though tho produco
should have been ten for one.’

Erravit aut] ‘ Aut ’ is found only in 141.
42; but Zumpt, Klotz, and lordan have
preferred it. Orelli, who had not the eol-
lations of the Lg. MSS.. has ‘erravit an
potius.’ There is a differenem for ‘an'
