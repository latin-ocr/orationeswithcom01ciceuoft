536 IN O. VERREM

non dicam id quod debeam forsitan obtinere, quum judicium certa
lege sit, non quid in re militari fortiter feceris, sed quemadmodum
manus ab alienis pecuniis abstinueris, abs te doceri oportere: non,
inquam, sic agam3 sed ita quaeram, quemadmodum te velle 111-
telligo, quae tua opera et quanta fuerit in bello.

Fateor, et magnum quidem ac Vehemens. Num igitur ex eo bello
partem aliquam laudis appetere conaris? num tibi illius victoriae
gloriam cum M. Crasso aut Cn. Pompeio communicatam putas?
Non arbitror hoc etiam tuae deesse impudentiae, ut quidquam ejus-

lege ' is properly used without ‘ e ⁵ or ‘ ex,'
I 3111 1101 quite sure; but I think that it
is. The words ‘ certa lege ’ imply a special

case, and if ‘constitutum' can be used
with ‘certa leges it follows that ‘consti-
tutum ' may apply to a special 0380. Who
would ever 83)* that a ‘judicium' (general),
a general forn] of trial or procedure, was
established by a ‘certa lexP’ It seems
that ‘ constitutum’ may apply either to a
general rule (Lib. 1. 0. 9), 01· to what is
arranged and ordered in a particular case.
(Divin. 0. 15, ‘si tu eris actor consti-
tutus.')

2. At in Italia] This was the war
which Spartacus stirred up B.c. 73, and it
cost the Romans some trouble to put down
this vigorous rebel and his hands. L.
Crassus at last succeeded in breaking the
force of Spartacus 3 and Cn. Pompeius, on
his return from Spain (B.C. 71), got more
credit for destroying a remnant of them
than 110 deserved. Plutarch (Crassus, 0.
11, and Pompeius, 0,. 21) has told the

ίτῖαε deesse] Ernesti found a difficulty
here, and thought that we should write
‘essa’ That which caused a difficulty to
him, may cause a difficulty to others, -‘ l

but this form of expression is not exactly
that of Cicero, which is this: ‘I don't
think that your impudence requires this
also to complete it.’

obstitisti] That Cicero as 3 prosecutor
exaggerated things is shown by a fragment
of Sallust's Hist. iv. 31, ed. Kritz: “ C.
Verres litora Italiae propinqua firma-
vit.'’ (Hahn.)

conarentur aet-edera] The editions
place a note of interrogation after ‘ 3000-
dere,' as if a question were contained in
‘quum . . . accedere‚' which is inanifestly
a mistake.

et illud] Ernesti proposed to write
‘at' for ‘et ;’ and Halm ‘sed’ for ‘et.'
Ι do not think that any change should be
made.

ratibus conjunctis] This can only mean
‘by making rafts? In Caesar, B. G. i. 8,
Ι think ‘navibus junctis’ means ‘by
bridges of boats.'

At quum esset] This is supposed to be
urged on the side of Verres, to which
