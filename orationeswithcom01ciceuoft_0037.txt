lez· consultum esse vult ?] ‘Vult' ex-
presses the desigu or purpose of the law,
conformably to the general sense of ‘ velle,’
which is not the ‘wisln’ but the ‘vm'lL’
‘ Cupere ' is the ‘ desire,' ‘ velle ' is the ‘ re-
solve,’ ‘ optare ³ is the ‘ 0110100 ’ 01· ‘ selec-
tion’ out of various things presented of

(lan have ‘per alium aliqucm,' the reading
of Gl 2 D C ς.

7. At enim solidum effen] Comp. c. l«,
‘At 0111111 eur‚' which means, ‘ well, but it
may be said why,' &a Here it means,
‘well‚ suppose this be established that,'
&c. ‘The other thing, 1 suppose, is not

one that seems the best. See 0. 14, ‘ potcs-
tatem optionemque.) The distinction of
‘ cupiditas ' and ‘ voluntas ’ is clear.

στιν his] ‘eur iis,’ Iordan ; a matter of
indifl'erenee here : the words. ‘ii ’ aud ‘ hi '
are constantly confounded or interelnmged
in the MSS. A little further on Orelli had
‘ Num te actore: &Q which 15 the reading
of some inferior Mss, and ‘ 1111110 ’ of 0110
MS. But ‘ nam‚’ the reading of Klotz,
Zumpt, and Iordan, appears to bo the true
reading5 and ‘nam' is easily eonfounded
with ‘num‚' and ‘ 1111111 ’ with (11111103 lf
we read ‘ num,’ tho word ‘quem ' has the
force of an enclitic without having its
place, which should be next to ¹ 1111111 3’ for
the interrogation lies in the ‘ num.' But
the interrogation ought to be iu the
‘quem,' and that 01111 only 1)0 111( reading
‘ nam.’ This use of ‘ nam‚’ not to express
au intel-enee, but 11 transition to a thing on
which the speaker does not intend to dwell,
is very eonnnon. Comp. De Λιιι. 0. 27,
‘ Nam quid de studiis,’ ἂι, and 0. 13,
‘nam quilmsdam,' &eq and Scyllert's note.
—‘ 1101· aliquem ε’ Zumpt, Klotz, and lor-

clear,' &c.‚ which is said ironieally, ‘ eredo’
being often tlms employed. All the known
MSS. have ‘ sohnn‚' which may have arisen
from 1111 abbreviation of ‘solidun1.’ But
Lambinus allirms that some MSS. have
‘solidunn’ It is eurious to see how the
eonnnentators have handled this matter in
the Variorum edition.

‘ Solidum ' means ⁶ whole‚' ‘ entire,' or,
if we 0110050, ‘ eloai-,⁵ as opposed to ⁸ 0115011-
1·11111.’ The sense is this : ⁸ well, you grant
1110 al] this that,’ tha, ‘you aeknowledge
that this admissiou is completely due to
1110;’ in which sense it 15 very near ahin
to the legal sense os ‘ solidum ' in an ¹ obli-
gatio‚' where there may be several debtors,
and each bound in the whole sum to the
creditor (Di-g. -1-5. 2. 3). Klotz, Zumpt.
and lordan have ‘solinus which l don't
understand.

anth-us (jus sibi] Hortensius is meant.
und the word ⁸ Hortensius‘ is inserted al't er
⁴ tibi ' by some editors, though it. is omitted
iu the best MSS.
