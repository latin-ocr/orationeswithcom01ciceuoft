IN G. VERREM

Siculos tueri ac retinere voluerunt, ut non modo eorum agris vectigal
novum nullum imponerent, sed ne legem quidem venditionis decu-
marum neve vendundi aut tempus aut locum commutarent, ut
certo tempore anni, ut ibidem in Sicilia, denique ut lege Hieronica
venderent: voluerunt eos in suis rebus ipsos interesse3 eorumque
animos non modo lege nova sed ne nomine quidem legis—novo

lege Hieronica venderent :] This sys-
tem of taxation was established by Hiero
IL, who died probably B.C. 216. His land-
tax was a tenth of the produce. The let-
ting ofthe ‘vectigalia' 111 general, as already
observed, was managed at Rome by the
censors, and the farmers of them were the
Societates of Publicani. This ‘censoria
locatio' applied also, as Cicero says, to a
small number of towns in Sicily. But
other ‘ civitates ' were under the Lex Hie-
ronica. Their lands were subject to the
‘decumae,’ which the ‘aratores' had to
pay; and these ‘decumae’ were let or sold,
which is the Roman expression, to Publi-
cani, who were called Decumani. They
were let or sold at Syracuse (c, 64). The
expression ‘decumas emisse' occurs in c.
12; and in c. 8 we have the equivalent
expression, ‘ in locandis vectigalibus³ To
buy the ‘decumae' is an ambiguous ex-
pression, for it might signify to buy the
right of collecting them for ever. But
this is not the meaning of the Roman ex-
pression. To buy and to sell the ‘ decumae ’
expresses a contract for a given time, by
which contract the farmers of the revenue
gave a sum of money for the tenths for a
fixed period. We might doubt whether
such a contract was a case of ‘emptio et
venditio,' or of ‘locatio‚ conductio? The
following passage from the Institutiones
of J ustinian will explain what is meant:
“ Adeo autem familiaritatem aliquam inter
se habere videntur emptio et venditio,
item locatio et conductio ut in quibusdam
causis quaeri soleat, utrum emptio et ven-
ditio contrahatur an locatio et conductio.
Ut ecce de praediis, quae perpetuo qui-
busdam fruenda traduntur, id est ut quam-
diu pensio sive reditus pro his domino
praestetur, neque ipsi conductori neque he-
redi ejus, cuive conductor heresve ejus id
praedium vendiderit, aut donaverit, aut do-
tis nomine dederit aliove quo modo aliena-
verit, auferre liceat: sed talis contractus
quia inter veteres dubitabatur, et a quibus-
dam locatio, a quibusdam venditio existima-
batur, lex Zenoniana lata est, quac emphy-
teuseos contractui propriam statuit natu-

ram‚” ἀρ. (1nst.1fi. at. 21, (25) ). In the

same way, the Romans applied the term
‘ selling ² to the furnishing of the inhabit-
ants of a town with a certain supply of
water by those to whom the management
of this part of municipal administration
was entrusted. The administrators were
said to sell this water, though the agree-
ment belongs more to the head of ‘locatio‚
conductio‚’ than to the head of ‘emptio‚
venditio? (Zeitschrift fiir Geschichtl.

non modo] Cicero clearly means to say
that the Romans willed that the Siculi
should not be disturbed by a new ‘ lex,' or
even by the change of the name of the old
‘lex.' If the ‘modo' were omitted, the first
‘non’ would negative ‘lege.’ As it stands,
the ‘non' negatives ‘modo lege,' &c. The
meaning is plain: they m'lled that ‘not in
any degree‚’ hy a new ‘ lex‚' should they be
disturbed, and not even by a new name of
the ‘ lex? It is the Roman fashion to make
‘ sed' the adversative of ‘non,' which we
do sometimes. And if we do it here, we
must resort to the form of a double negative
—not only that they should not be disturbed
by a new ‘lex‚' but not even by the new
name of an old ‘ lex.’ But this is not the
Roman form of expression, and it leads us
to the false supposition of ‘ non> modo '
being put for ‘non modo non.’ Another
‘ non ' after ‘modo ³ is not wanted. Some-
times ‘ non 50111111 ’ stands in the first clause,
followed by ‘ne—quidem‚' as 111 this pas-
sage. In both cases there is only a single
verb of predication, which is placed 111 the
‘ ne—-quidem' clause. In a passage 111 ’
Lib. 2. c. 72, ‘non modo id non dices,'
&c., some MSS. omit the ‘non’ before
‘ dices,' where the copyist may have been
misled by the words ¹ sed ne illud quidem
tibi dicere licebit‚’ which follow. But if the
‘ non’ before ⁶ dices' were omitted, it would
make palpable nonsense ς for the ‘id' re-
fers to what has been mentioned in· the pre-
ceding sentence, and the ‘ illud’ refers to
what Cicero says at the end 'of this sen-
tence. “ It is not an, that you won't be
able to deny this (id)——‘ nihil in istis literis
