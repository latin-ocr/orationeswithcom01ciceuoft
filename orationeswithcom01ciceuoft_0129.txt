follows Madvig in placing a comma after
‘adventus,’ aud I suppose that he uu-
derstands it as Klotz does. ‘Adven-
tus' is often used in the plural (De Imp.
Cu. Pompeii, c. 5; De Lege Agraria,
i. 53 Pro Archia, 0. 3). But when Cicero
speaks of 3 single ‘ adventus ' or one per-
sou's ‘ adventus ³ 110 uses the singular. Sec
De Imp. Cu. Pompeii, 0. 5, and the note.
As to the ‘equosj there is 110 difficulty,
though Asconius makes one: 110 required
horses of the people, as well as other ser-
vices.

quotidianis] ‘common.' So the com-
mon Interdictum de vi is called Quotidi-
anum (Pro Caecina, c. 31); aud Pro
Tullio, ξ 51, “agi quidem usitato jure et
quotidiana actione potuit.”

in comitio] The Roman ‘ aediles ' some-
times borrowed valnable works of nrt from
the provinces for the embellislnnent of the,
public exhibitions, which it was their office
to give to the Romans, It seems likely
enough that such loans were not always
returned, though in the instance of this
statue of Tenes it must have been so.
Klotz refers to Act. ii. Lib. 3. 0. 4, and
Lib. 4. c. 3, for further matter as to this
mode. of decorating the ‘ comitium? Aa to

,Iunonis Samiae,] Herodotus (iii. 60)
speaks of the temple of Hera at Sarum,
as the largest that he had seen. In Strabo's
time (p. 637) the Heraeum was a ‘ 11111300-
tlieke,' or ‘ picture gallery ς’ and the Hyp-
aethruxn was filled with the finest statues.
11· Cicero means to blame Nero indirectly,
there seems 110 ground for it ; for, though
tho rohhery was conunitted in the province
of Asia, of which Nero was governor, Verres
was tho ‘ legatus ' of Dolabella. Nero told
the people that they must carry their 00111-
plaiut to Rome, and we 1113)· suppose that
he told them the truth, but it was small
consolation to the men who were scamiu-
lons-ly pillaged.

obsi-quatuo] The passage shows that the
prosecutor had the power of putting Ι31313

passage which Asconius, as usual, expresses
in other words.

eolttmna.v,] These statues were placed
at columns, and 111 the intercolmnniati‹ms
(intercolumnia), or arranged in the planted
grounds or ‘ horti ’ (silva). These column<
may have been in the atrium and the
peristylo of Verres’ house. The Romans
were fond of gardenS, which they decorated
with statues and works of art. (Hor. Ep.
i. 10. 22.) This kind os ‘silva ' was some-
times called (111-1113011131]
