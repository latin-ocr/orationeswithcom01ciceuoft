midinem illam suam miseris Agyrinensibus injiciebat : recuperatores
se de cohorte sua daturum minabatur. Agyrinenses viri fortissimi
judicio se passuros esse dicebant. Ingerebat iste Artemidorum
Cornelium medicum et Tlepolemum Cornelium pictorem et ejus-
modi recuperatores, quorum civis Romanus nemo erat, sed Graeci
sacrilegi, jampridem improbi, repente Cornelii. Videbant Agyri-
nenses quidquid ad eos recuperatores Apronius attulisset, illum
perfacile probaturum: condemnari cum istius invidia infamiaque
malebant quam ad ejus conditiones pactionesque accedere. Quae-
rebant quae in verba recuperatores daret. Respondebat‚ s1 PARET

or affected to be, Roman citizens ; but
Cicero means to insinuate that they had
assumed the name of ‘Cornelii' all at once.
Sulla made a great number of ‘ Cornelii ' of
manumitted slaves (Appian, Civil War,Lib.
1. c. 100. 104); and these men may have
been among them; or, as there were so
many ‘Cornelii,' they may have thought
that they might venture on assuming the
name. This is one of the passages from
which an argument has been derived that
Cornelius was the gentile nume of Verres,
and that these men, being his freedmen,
had, as was usual in sueh cases, taken the.
gentile name of their ‘ patronus.' But this
conclusion is by no means certain. Cieero
gives no indication that thoy were freedmen
of Verres. Cicero calls them ‘Graeci sa-
crilegi ' probany in allusion to their having
assisted Verres to rob the temples of the
Greeks; for Artemidorus is charged (e. 21)
with assisting Verres to rob the temple of
Diana at Perga. As to ‘sacrilegus’ see
Lib. 1. e. 3.

quae in rerba] Thut is, whut would be
the form iu whieh the denmnd against them
should be put? or, in other words, what
would be the formula? ln place of ‘si
paret,’ the old editions had the usual blun-

rest have ‘pareret' or ‘pateret-,² or some
other erroneous form. We now know the
genuine form, ‘ si paret,’ from Gaius.

Zumpt reads ‘ (11111111 rem in judicio?

‘ in qua re‚’ which he explains ‘ seil. Agy-
rinenses adversum edictum fecissent) Yet
‘quum in rem’ may be the true reading.

what the corrupt word ‘septu ' indicates.
