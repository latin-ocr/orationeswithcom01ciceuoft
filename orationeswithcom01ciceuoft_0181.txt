there 15, ‘Quid est suo cuique ,Ψ in V.
Manufius reads ‘bono suo quoque. ' But

‘suo cuique' is probably right, and 001·-
reetly explained by Graevius: ‘let him
make the work good with what 15 fit and
proper for each part? “Suo euique‚‘’ says
Graevius‚‘ ‘est quod 51111111 01110110 est, illa
materia quae adquodque requiritur, cuique
convenit ut bonum fiat-3³ He compares the
expression in Plautus, ‘suo sibi victu
vivunt? though, he 011115, 110 15 aware that
this is explained differently, and ‘ sihi ' 15
considered to be pleonastic. Menas-d 1105
the seme as Graevius.

Lapis ᾦα] Orelli reads ‘Lapis aliquis
dcc„ fuit? Machina sua: nam illo, ἄας’
and he explains it thus = “ ‘ Lapis . . appor-
tandus fuit ?' Minime. Machina uantum
sua apportandas ‚apponenda fuit. Nam,

This passage is difficult. The words

‘Quid est’ Aac„ fromv, do not seem to
diminish the difficulty. It is true, as
Madv„ ‹rmum-ks, that Cieem, aster citing
formal 1101115, osten adds a remark upon
them. Ernesti placed a note of interroga-
tion aster ‘machina sua‚’ which neither
Zumpt nor Madvig approves. If‘ lapis’
