348 IN G. VERREM

Symmacho O. Annaeus Brocchus, senator, homo eo splendore, ea
virtute qua omnes existimatis, nummos praeter frumentum coactus
est daie. Venereone servo te praetore talis vir, senator populi
Romani, quaestui fuit?

XLI. Hunc ordinem si dignitate antecellere non existimabas, ne
hoc quidem sciebas, judicare P Antea quum equester ordo judi-
caret, improbi et rapaces magistratus in provinciis inserviebant x
publicanis : ornabant eos qui in operis erant : quemcunque equitem
Romanum in provincia viderant, beneficiis ac liberalitate proseque-
bantur: neque tantum illa res nocentibus proderat quantum obfuit
multis, quum aliquid contra utilitatem ejus ordinis voluntatemque
fecissent. Retinebatur hoc tum nescio quomodo quasi communi
consilio ab illis diligenter, ut, qui unum equitem Romanum contu-
melia dignum putasset, ab universo ordine malo dignus judicaretur:
tu sic ordinem senatorium despexisti, sic ad libidines injuriasque
tuas omnia coaequasti, sic habuisti statutum cum animo ac delibe-
ratum, omnes qui habitarent in Sicilia aut qui Siciliam te praetore
attigissent judices rejicere, ut illud non cogitares tamen ad ejusdem

on the J udicia.——‘ beneficiis . . prosequeban-
tur: ·' this is a usual form of expression, but
we have nothing like it. Cicero means

‘the Magistratus treated them favoui ably
and liberallyj or something of that kind.

. judicarem] See Excursus dunt operas mutuas’ (Ter. Phorm. ii. 3.

>quasi communi eon-silio] Cicero gives
us an example of the conduct of men who
are bound together by some common in-
terest. All of them become the enemies

The fcice of the phrase is in the 1100113.

collect their dues; and Cicero explains 11 hy.
The collection of the ‘xectigalia’ in the

Hindustan. Cicero (Pro Plancio, 0. 19)
says: J am ut ego doceo, gratiosum esse

Thus they helped one another for a con-

Terence says it all in a few words, ‘ Tra-

of every man who touches their interests
in the person of any member of their body.
Thus in modern states the interests of a
whole community are often sacrificed to
the greediness of a few men, who are
closely united by the common purpose of
making their profit out of the 1033 of
others.

qui habitarent] Lg. 42 N φ have (Ῐια-
herent, quod Garatonius perite defendit’
(Zumpt). The objection made to ‘ habita-
rent’ 13, that very few Roman senators
could have dwelt (habitasse) in Sicily.
But Cicero says ‘ aut . . attigissent,' leaving
his hearers to apply ‘habitarent' to as
many or as few as they pleased. Further,
it is said, it is probable that many senators
might have held lands there (habuisse agros
101 praedia) ς but the reasons for the pro-
bability are not stated. The assertion that
it is improbable is quite as good. Finally,

‘haberent in Sicilia' is an odd phrase to
express ownership of land in Sicily, and
requires confirmation. It is not exactly
like‘ habet 111 11011111113’ (0. 86).
