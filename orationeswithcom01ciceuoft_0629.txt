ACT. II. LIBER QUINTUS. 609

tissimi venerunt ad hoc judicium mercatores, homines locupletes
atque honesti, qui partim socios suos, partim libertos, ab isto spo-
liatos, in vincula conjectos, partim in vinculis necatos, partim securi
percussos esse dicunt. Hic vide quam me sis usurus aequo. Quum
ego P. Granium testem produxero qui suos libertos abs te securi
percussos esse dicat, qui abs te navem suam mercesque repetat,
refellito, si poteris 3 meum testem deseram, tibi favebo : te, inquam,
adjuvabo: ostendito illos cum Sertorio fuisse, a Dianio fugientes ad
Siciliam esse delatos. Nihil est quod te mallem probare: nullum
enim facinus quod majore supplicio dignum sit reperiri neque pro·
ferri potest. Reducam iterum equitem Romanum, L. Flavium, si
voles 3 quoniam priore actione, ut patroni tui dictitant, nova quadam
sapientia, ut omnes intelligunt, conscientia tua atque auctoritate
meorum testium testem nullum interrogasti. Interrogetur Flavius,
si voles, quinam fuerit T. Herennius, is quem ille argentariam Lepti

gentarius ³ was to exchange various kinds

vessel then came to Rhegium, and thence on
of money for merehants and others, as is

the second day to Puteoli, where St. Paul

landed (Acts, xxviii. 11—14). Madvig,
quoted by Zumpt, refers to several passageS,
which show that Puteoli was a place of
great trade at this time. Suetonius (Aug. c.
98) speaks of an Alexandrian ship saluting
Augustus as he was sailing past the har-
bour of Puteoli. See also Strabo, p. 793,

ed. Cas.

Cicero’s allusion (De Fin. ii. 26) to the
‘ Puteolis granaria ' seems to show that it
was a dcpsst for corn.

Herennius is called a ‘negotiator ' (Lib. 1.
c. 5). He carried on his business at Lep-
tis in Africa, from which it was a short
cut to Sicily, whither his affairs, we may
suppose, occasionally took him. Cicero’s
Leptis may be Leptis Minor, now Lempta,
which was in the Byzacium, and south of
Hadrumetum. Halm says that Cicero
means Leptis Magna, now Lelula, on the
coast between the SyrteS. There is no-
thing which can determine which of the
two places Cicero means, bnt it is‘more
probahle that he means the city which is
nearer to Sicily. The business of an ‘ ar-

now done by money-changerS. He proba-
bly also received deposits, and advanced
money on security, as we see in the case
mentioned by Gaius (iv. 64), where ac-
counts between the ‘ argentarius’ and Ti-
tius are spoken of. Ernesti has a disser-
tation on the ‘negotiatores’ They are
easily distinguished from ‘ mercatores,’ who
are dealers in wares3 and from ¹ aratores ’
and cattle-feeders (Verr. Lib. 2. c. 3).
Τ110 general term ‘negotiator ¹ appears to
include ‘argentarius.’ The Roman eapi-
talists used to resort to the provinces, in
order to turn their money to account.
The least laborions way of making a capi-
tal profitable in 11 new settlement, or in a
country where money is searce, is to lend
on security, and get a high rate of interest.
It does not appear that a Roman ‘nego-
tiator' made any other venture in tho
provinces than that of placing out his
money at interest3 und he was not re-
strained by any rules of law as to the rate
of interest that he could demand. 11· he
employed his capital in any other way, he
was not 11 ‘ negotiator,’ except, as it seems,
the ‘negotiatores' sometimes made largo
purchases of grain, and probably other
articles, for a venture to Rome ; or, which
is quite as likely, produce and other arti-
cles, on which they had made advanceS,
would sometimes fall into their hands
from the inahility ot' their debtors to puy
what had been advaneed.
