644 SICILY A ROMAN PROVINCE.

of all Sicily-to 1‚190‚592 persons.” It is easy to make several objections
to these concl'usions. Premises are assumed which cannot be admitted.
For instance, who can assume that Hiero’s part of the island was exactly
one-third of the whole island, or rather that it contained exactly one-
third of the population? Ι have no doubt that the relative population of
Hiero's part was greater than that of the rest of the island.

It remains to make a few remarks on the object of the Romans in
collecting the ‘ decumae ’ of Sicily, and the ‘ frumentum emptum.’ The
corn was for the supply of Rome, the city only as it seems. It was an
old Roman policy sor the state to look after the supply of corn sor Rome.
We cannot suppose that private enterprise did not partly supply the
city3 but in times of scarcity at least persons were appointed to buy on
account of the state. Livy, on some authority we may presume, speaks
of such purchases at an early period of Roman history (ii. 9, iv. 12);
and in the second of these passages the creation of a ‘ praefectus
annonae ’ is mentioned. On the occasion of a scarcity so early as the
consulship of T. Geganius and P. Minucius (3.0. 492), Rome sent to
seek for corn in Sicily (Liv. ii. 34). The possession of Sicily assured a
large supply from the regular ‘decumam’ and more could be had, if it
was wanted, by a demand of the ‘alterae decumae ' and the ‘ frumentum
imperatum.’ The Lex Frumentaria of O. Gracchus (Rc. 123) substi-
tuted for the occasional and irregular distributions of corn at Rome, the
sale of it at a low fixed price (Lib. 3. c. 70, note) ; and in this way the
‘decumae’ of Sicily seem to have been disposed of in B.c. 70, when
Cicero prosecuted Verres. The gratuitous distribution of corn at Rome
belongs to a later period in the life of Cicero, and not to the period of
Verres, as Dureau de la Malle assumes. The discussion of the pauper
system of Rome does not belong to this place.
