436 FORMULA OOTAVIANA.

his pocket in spite of his resistance‚ oris he is prevented by physical
force from doing something which he wishes to do, voting at an election,
making his testament, or the like. If no force is used, but the will is
operated on by threats, that is, by producing sear, this is ‘metus'
Savigny observes (Systmn, dcc„ iii. p. 101, note (a) )‚ that the opposition
between ‘vis’ and ‘ metus’ appears most clearly in the case of the loss
of possession ; for possession may be lost either through physical force or
through threats. If a man is forcibly ejected, that is Dejectio, and to this·
case applied the ‘ Interdictum de vi’ (Dig. 43. 1615). If a man gives
up possession through threats, that is compulsive Traditio (delivery),
and the ‘ Actio quod metus causa’ applies (Dig. 4. 2. 9). The Romans did
not consider that fear produced by threats took away the free exercise
of the will. The cases to which the ‘Actio quod metus ⁷ applies are not
those where physical force was used, but where sear was produced by
threats; they were cases in which the persen had chosen to act in
obedience to the threat rather than submit to the consequences of
refusal. Such are the numerous cases mentioned in these orations,
where persons had through fear, and some through pain, consented to
comply with the demands of Verres or his agents. The Romans were
right in saying that threats do not exclude the freedom of the will3 and
accordingly they did not consider acts done under the influence of this
kind of sear to be void. But they gave a remedy to the person who had
acted under the influence of the motive of fear caused by threats3 and
the ground was this, that means to induce him to consent had been
applied, which were immoral, just as it is immoral to tempt a. woman’s
chastity by money; and only one degree less immoral than to violate it
by force. Wherever then immoral means are applied to induce consent,
the consenting party is entitled to restitution or reparation as far as it is
possible. What means are immoral is a matter that may be safely left
to the ‘communis sensuS,’ the moral notions of all people who are not
immediately interested in the decision of any particular case. This sub·
ject is discussed by Savigny‚ System, Vol. iii„ Zwang und Irrthum.

It is possible that some things in this Excursus may not be quite
consistent with some things that occur elsewhere in this book. The
explanation is this: there are great difficulties in some of the subjects
discussed in this volume, and certain differences of opinion about them.
