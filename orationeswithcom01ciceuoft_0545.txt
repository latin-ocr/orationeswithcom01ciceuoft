et quae acceperant tradere deberent, petisse ut sibi quod hae res
Ι abessent ignosceretur: itaque omnes liberatos discessisse, et esse
ignotum omnibus : quas ego literas obsignandas publico signo depor-

tandasque curavi.

De laudatione autem ratio sic mihi reddita est:

primum quum a O. Verre literae aliquanto ante adventum meum
de laudatione venissent, nihil esse decretum: deinde, quum quidam
ex illius amicis commonerent oportere decerni, maximo clamore
esse et convicio repudiatos: posteaquam meus adventus appro-
pinquaret, imperasse eii—m qui summam potestatem haberet ut de-
cernerent: decretum ita esse ut multo plus illi laudatio mali quam
boni posset afferre. Id adeo, judices, ut mihi ab illis demonstratum

est, sic vos ex me cognoscite.

eeperat‚' which we must take to be a
blunder of the copyist. It is no objection
to the plural that Cicero does not use
‘quisque,’ ‘ unusquisque,’ with the plural ;
on which Zumpt has a note (Act. i. c. 14 3
Lib. 2. c. 39).

Zumpt writes ‘e lege’ in place of ‘ex
Iege? He is not quite certain whether
there is any difference between ‘e lege'
and ‘ex lege? On this matter ‘subdubi-
tat: and he refers to his note on Lib. 2.
c. 17, where he has ‘e lege‚' ‘lege,’ ‘ex
lege,’ all in the same chapter. It may be
doubtful whether Cicero wrote ‘ e lege ’ or
‘ex lege‚' though not doubtful that the
Romans generally would write it both ways.
But Cicero was particular in such matters,
aud may have preferred one form to the
other, though Ι 110 not recollect if he has
any where, among his multifarious com-
munieatiom, given ns his opinion on this
matter. 'l'he supposition of any diss'erence
in meaning between ‘ elege ’ and ‘ ex lege ’
is rather too trifling to be discussed.

But there is another matter herc that re-
quires notice. (12 Ld. have ‘ lege ' only ς
111111 Zumpt thinks that ‘lege ’ by itsclf is
not good Latin3 and he recollects 110 111-
stance of it, except in the. common formula
‘ lege agere? He has apparently forgotten
‘lege Rupilia,' in Lib. 2. c. 17; for if we
ean say ‘ ex lege Rupilia? ‘ e lege Rupilia:
‘lege Rupilia,’ and ‘ ex lege‚’ we may per-
haps say ‘ lege ’ simply. Again, he 11115 111
11 note on Lib. 5. 0. 5, the following passage
from Quintilian (lnst. v. 7. 9, ac..) 1 “ 11110
genera sunt testium aut voluntariorum aut
eorum quibus 111 judiciis lege demmtiari
solet.'’ Zumpt was 11 good critic, and 11
sensible man, but his memor-y was not
strong. 1 have no confidenee 111 many of
his minor canons· 'rhat ‘lege' can be so

used is certain. (See Lib. 2, c. 17, note.)
As ‘ lex,' in its proper sense, means α ‘ lex,’
it 15 usual to join the name to it, 115 ‘ Julia,'
and so forth 3 but when the ‘lex ³ has been
mentioned, or it is clearly understood what
‘lex' is meant, the qualifying name may
be omitted. Zumpt takes ‘ex lege' here
to be the same in sense as in Lib. 1. c. 54,
‘ Rabonius qui legem nosset ε’ the ternis
of the contract. I am inclined to think
that he means a law proper, under which
the care of these things was given to certain
people, and they were bound to give them
up as they received them. The ‘lex,’ in
fact, contained the ternis by which they
were bound; but it was not here ‘id quod
contractum Icti vocant,' as Zumpt says.
In this passage Ernesti would make ‘ lege ’
equivalent to ‘ inventario,' which is a mis-
take.

obsfiqnandis publico siquo] Cicero car-
ried off these entries, and had their authen-
ticity attested by the 50111 of the city. Thus
we see that in those days, 111-11110101 persons',
as citios, and Res Publicae of various kinds,
had their 50111 as the evidence of the act ot·
the artificial person. The practice 11115 been
transmitted to 0111· own 1111)·5. Compare
Pro Flacco, c. 15.

appropinquaret,] The reading os Zumpt,
in his larger edition, in place of ‘amn-opin-
quarit.’ Halm proposes to write ‘postea
cum ' for ‘posteaqinun‚' “ ut et asyndeton
vitetur et conjunctivus imperfecti recte 50
habeat ’' (Iordan).

Id adem] Zumpt givos to these words
the. meaning which he 11115 explained in his
Grannnar, ξ 319, ‘ ut fere polius sit! Let
the reader substitute ‘potius' for ‘adem'
and see if 110 01111 understand it. Zumpt
perhaps relies on such examples 115 occur
in Lib. 2. 0. 60, &c.‚ where the meaning of
