commercium] The meaning of Cicero
may be collected from his words. Diocles
was the lessee of lands in the ¹ ager Seges-
tanus' (conductum habebat), and he be-
longed to Panhormus. He could not hold
land as owner in the territory of Segesta,
‘ nam commercium in eo agro nemini est ς’
that is, the law of Segesta did not allow the
citizens of other places to be the owners of
land in the territory of Segesta. Becker
(Handbuch, ἃς. 111. 1, p. 245) quoting this
passage says “that in Sicily also most of
the states had no ‘ commercium ³ among
themselves 3³² and he adds that “the Centu-
ripini only (c. 45) had the capacity for
acquiring land in other states.” But his
first remark is a much larger conclusion
than Cicero's text allows 115 to make ς 311(1
the second is not consistent with the first.
·He also assumes that this limitation was a
Roman rule, like that in the case of Mace-
donia, which will presently be mentioned 3
but I do not admit that to be certain. It
may have been an old rule of law among
the Segestani to allow none but citizens to
acquire the ownership of land in their
territory.

Cicero uses a Roman word (commercium)
which had a technical meaning. It is fully
explained by Savigny : “ ‘ Connnercium ²
primarily signifies the legal capacity to buy
and sell ; this technical expression, how-
ever, does not refer to the usual selling of
daily life, but to the symbolical sale, which
the Romans call Mancipatio (Ulpian, tit. 19.

ξ 4, 5). But as Mancipatio has only a
significant meaning as the oldest and most
usual form of alienation of Roman owner-
ship, the capacity to have this most com-
plete kind of oximership is properly indi-
cated by this term 3 consequently, also, it
indicates the capacity of the In jure cessio,
of Usucapio, and of the strict Vindicatio.
Further developed, however, this technical
expression compl-ises also the capacity to
have Servitutes, which capacity, as well as
ownership, 15 J uris Quiritium, further, the
capacity to contract many kinds of obliga-
tions (Gaius, iii. 93, 94) ; finally, and most
especially, the Testamenti Factio, that is,
the fundamental condition of the capacity
to make a testament or a codicil, to be
named ‘ heres,' ‘legatee,' or ‘ fidei commis-
531·1115,’ 311(1 to be a witness to a testa-
ment '³ (System, &c., ii. 27). This inca-
pacity for any person not a Segestan to
hold land in the territory of Segesta may,
as I have said, not have been a rule made
by the Romans, but a custom of this parti-
cular state. The Romans sometimes 1111-
posed these ternis 011 conquered people,
with the view of keeping then] isolated and
weak communities, or, at any rate, of pre-
venting any close union among them. In
Livy (8. c. 14) we read, “Ceteris Latinis
populis connubia, commerciaque et concilia
inter se ademerm1t.” The object waS, to
break the national unity of the Latini.
Macedonia, after the Roman conquest (13.0.
168), was divided into four regions: “ pro-
nuntiavit deinde neque connubium neque
commercium agrorum aedificiorumque in-
ter se placere cuiquam extra fines regi-
