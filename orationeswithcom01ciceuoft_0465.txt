tended for ‘ sie rettulit ;’ and so Halm has
printed it. There are also the readings
‘vendita ; sed' R 3, and ‘vendita sic’
dett. Iordan does not say what is the
authority for ‘vendita sunt‚' which was
the former reading in this edition.

HS CIODC.] This reading agrees with
the x. CCCC 01· 400 ‘ denarii ’ of the follow-
ing chapter, for a ‘ denarius' was equiva-
lent to four ‘ sestertii?

’7. φηιηιίεἱεεεί ul] ‘ would have acted
in such a way aS‚' or ‘would have made
such a mistake as' ac. Comp. Lib. 1. c.
43, ‘nemo enim connnittcret.'

qui modus] The passion for works of
art among the wealthy Romans began
with the. conquest of Magna Graecia and
Greece Proper. We 111111 in Horace many
allusions to the large sums of money cx·
pcnded on such olijects, and particularly
on such as were of supposed high anti-
quity. Horat. 2 Sat. iii. 20:

 

“Olim nam quaerere amabam
QUO vaffrzille pedes lavasset Sisyphus
aere, cc.

‘ Hoc cratere ferox commisit praelia Rhoe-
cus
Cum Lapithis : pugna debile cernis
opus,' ’' &tn—Martini, viii. 6.

Heindorf observes that ‘signum ’ is said
of every work of the class of sculpture, also
ot* bu<ts and rilicvi ; on the contrarv,
‘ statua ’ is said of a figure that is cast, or
worked with the chisel, of the complete
lnnnan form, and ol* the sizo of life. ln 0.
31, a full-length ligure of Diana, of more
than the natural size, is called ‘signum ;’
and in c. 33 it- is mentioned under the
more general term ‘simulacrunn’ The
word ‘ signum ' is very general, and applied
to any work 011 which the chisel was used 3
and, as it seems, also to works cast in
mctal. ‘ Statua ' seems to be properly
applied to a full-length figure, from its
being adapted to be set up in public. An
&laestrian figure was called ‘statum’ not
‘signum’ (c. 40, ἁυ..) Ο1’ἰ11, Heroid.
