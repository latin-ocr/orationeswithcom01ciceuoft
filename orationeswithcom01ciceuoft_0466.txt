aestimationis : difficile est enim finem facere pretio si non libidini
feceris. Video igitur Heium neque voluntate neque difficultate
aliqua temporis nec magnitudine pecuniae adductum esse ut
haec signa venderet, teque ista simulatione emptionis vi, metu, im-
perio, fascibus, ab homine eo, quem una cum ceteris sociis non
solum potestati tu ae sed etiam fidei populus Romanus commiserat,
eripuisse atque abstulisse. Quid mihi tam optandum, judices,
potest esse 111 1100 crimine quam ut haec eadem dicat ipse Heius?
N ihil piofecto: sed ne difficilia optemus. Heius est Mamertinus:

Mamertina civitas istum publice communi consilio sola laudat:
omnibus iste ceteris Siculis odio est; ab his solis amatur: ejus
autem legationis quae ad istum laudandum missa est princeps est
Heius, etenim est primus civitatis, ne forte, dum publicis mandatis
serviat, de privatis injuriis reticeat. Haec quum scirem et cogi-
tarem, commisi tamen, judices, Heio : produxi [eum] prima actione ;
neque id tamen ullo periculo feci. Quid enim poterat Heius respon-

glass, and ‘gemmae' The Greek word
τορευτική expresses the art of the (03013-
t0r3’ but ‘toreutic’ was also applied to

Any full-length figure placed any where
may be a ‘statua' (Pomponius, Dig. 50.
16. 245), “ statuae affixae basibus structi-

libus,'' &c., where there is a good rule as
to the law of fixtures.

Sillig, in his Catalogus, speaks of bronze-
casters as ‘ statuarii,’ and makers of marble
statues as ‘sculptores' The word ‘ seulp-
tor ' seems to be the appropriate word for
a worker in marble, and ( scalptor ' to (10-
note a cutter of stones, or ‘ gemmae? The
two verbs ‘ scalpere ' and ‘ sculpere,' which
are really the same word, are often con-
founded in the MSS. 3 but yet it is possible
that usage may have assigned one to ex-
press sculpture, and the other to express
gem-cutting. A gem or stone-cutter was
sometimes called δακτυλιογλύφος by the
Greeks. There is apparently no difl'erence
between ’γλύφω 31111 Ὑλάφω. ( Caelator'
(Sillig, I'reface) properly signifies one who
employed metal for the making of smaller
things, 35 cups, meta] vases, and the like 3
but it was also applied to workers in other
material, so as to comprehend all who
made ‘bassi rilievi‚’ whether in metal 01·
marble. But, as work in marble was the
sculptor’s province, Sillig limits ‘ caelator'
to workers in metal, who were sometimes
called ‘ vaseularii,⁵ of whom Mentor is an
example. Quintilian (lust. ii. 21. S) limits
‘ caelatura ³ to the working on gold, silvcr,
bronze, and iron 3 but he makes ‘ sculptura'
to comprehend all that ‘caelatura’ does,
and also working on wood, ivory, marblc,

those 00105531 statues which Phidias made,
called Chryselephantine, which were of
wood, overlaid with gold and ivory. Mul-
ler, Handbuch der Archaelogic der Kunst,
will supply references both to ancient and
modern authorities.

temporis] Cicero often uses this word
to express something transitory, a tempo-
rary difficulty, a temporary motive, a
matter of immediate sels-interest, and the
like.

sola laudat s] See 0. 65, “Ut laudatio
quac C. Verri decreta esset tolleretur?

nesorte, dc] Hotmann says that some-
thing is wanting. Lambinus changed
‘ serviat' to ‘ servit? Zumpt adopts
Beck’s incorrect explanation, ‘omissa ve-
rendi notione.² P. Manutius one of the
best of the interpreters of Cicero, says cor-
rectly : “ J oci genus, quasi civitas id spec-
taverit, cum legatum misit : quod ei certe
propositum non fuit3 ipse tamen utrum—
que fceit, et faciet. ''

commisi famen] The word me, 'which
is usually added, is properly omitted by
Zumpt. It 15 not‘ 1110, ’‘but r,em' as in
Lib. 3. 0. 71, ‘quibus hoc committam?
But the‘ rem' 0311 110 omitted, as in De
Lig. Ag r. ii. 8, ‘univeiso populo neque
ipse (‹)1ninittit,' δῖα, cited by Madvig.
Lib. 3. 0. 60, ‘negat se . . . commis-
su1·.um'
