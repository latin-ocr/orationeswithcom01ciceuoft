176 LEX VOCONIA.

Zumpt contends that the Lex Voconia was enacted in the early part
of ΒΘ 174, in the consulship of Sp. Postumius Albinus and Q. Mucius
Scaevola, in which same year were elected the censors A. Postumius and
Q. Fulvius, who are mentioned in the Edict of Verres (Lib. 1. c. 41).
The operation of the Lex of Voconius would accordingly date from that
census, and the Edict of Verres was so formed as to operate also from
that census. Zumpt explains the passage in the De Re Publica thus :—-
“ Crassus had two daughters, but Philus supposes the case of his having
only one3 and he says, that if he had only one, he could give her, in the
way of legacy, even ‘milliens,’ provided he gave his ‘heres' no less.
And yet Philus could not give a daughter by his testament even
‘ triciens,’ which was all that he had3 that is, as we must suppose Zumpt
to mean, he could not give her even ‘ triciens ' as ‘ heres.’ '’

In the article Voconia Lex, under Lex in Smith’s Dictionary of
Antiquities, there is an inconsistency, or an error, if any one chooses to
call it so, in mentioning the date of the Lex Voconia, as fixed by Cicero
at B.c. 169, and shortly after speaking of Postumius and Fulvius as
the censors of that year3 for they were the censors of the year B.c. 174.
I did not believe that Rc. 169 was the date of the Lex, notwithstanding
what Cicero says3 and I understood the words of the Lex as quoted by
Cicero (Lib. 1. c. 42) ‘⁶ qui post eos censoreS,” &c., to be explained by
the words of the Edict of Verres, “ Qui ab A. Postumio, Q. Fulvio cen-
soribus '² (c. 41). As the omission of this explanation, which ought to
have been inserted, makes a difficulty, Ι take this opportunity of setting
that matter straight. I agree with Zumpt, whose note Ι had not read
then, that the date is B.c. 1¹74. Zumpt has given his reasons for this
opinion. In that article Ι have stated the difficulties of this Lex,
without removing them, for Ι did not understand the matter. I had
not then read Savigny’s essay. Now, after carefully looking at the
subject again, Ι think that the chief difficulties about this Lex still
remain unexplained, and must remain so for want of better evidence
than we possess.
