300 IN O. VERREM

id fuit nobis gratum admodum. Sed multo erit gratius si reliqua
voletis attendere : propterea quod in his omnibus quae antea dicta
sunt erat quaedam ex ipsa varietate ac novitate rerum et criminum
delectatio. Nunc tractare causam instituimus frumentariam, quae
magnitudine injuriae et re [fere] criminibus ceteris antecellit,
jucunditatis in agendo et varietatis minus habebit: vestra autem
auctoritate et prudentia dignissimum est, judices, in audiendi dili· ·
gentia non minus religioni tribuere quam voluptati. In hac causa
frumentaria cognoscenda haec vobis proponite, judices, vos de rebus
fortunisque Siculorum omnium, de civium Romanorum qui arant
in Sicilia bonis, de vectigalibus a majoribus traditis, de vita vic-
tuque populi Romani cognituros. Quae si magna atque adeo

genuine.

reliyioni] To the obligation of their
oath, to do justice. There will seldom be
any difficulty in translating this word, if
the reader will bear in mind that it is said
of man when viewed with reference to the
gods.

civium Romanorum qui arant] This
may be taken as one definition of ‘ara-
tores' On the matter of pointing a re-
mark may be made here. Zumpt, Klotz,
and Iordan write ‘de civium Romanorum,
qui arant in Sicilia, bonis, de ³ &c. Now
this is vicious in the extreme. We first
observe that the Romans would generally
say ‘ de civium Romanorum bonis,’ as ‘ de
consilii sententias and so forth. If these
‘civium Romanorum' are to be further
defined, it may be done briefly by ‘qui
arant in Sicilia ς’ but this is not said
with emphasis; it is pronounced as it
would be if one word in the genitive plu-
ral could represent these four wordS. It
is a qualffication, an exposition of the
terms ‘ civium Romanorum‚’ and the prac-
tice of fencing these words in with commas
has no other effect than to divert the
learner from what he would see clearly if
the fences were removed. Cicero abounds
in examples of this collocation of words,
as in the letter Ad Q. Fr. i. 1. c. 15, “non
est tibi his solis utendum existimationibus
ac judiciis qui nunc sunt hominum ;'’ and
yet even here Orelli has hemmed in with
commas the ‘ qui nunc sunt?

Cicero (Lib. 2. c. 3), when he is speak-
ing of the advantages of Sicily to the Ro-
mans, says “quos illa partim retinet ut
arare, ut pascere, ut negotiari libeat, ut
denique sedes ac domicilium collocare.”
The ‘aratores' of Sicily were the culti-
vaters, who had to pay the ‘ decumae,’ or
tenths. The ‘arator’ is opposed to the
‘decumanuS‚' who farmed the tenths (c.
8. 10. 16, &c.). Some of these ‘ aratores ’
were Roman ‘equiteS,' as we see in the
case of Q. Lollius (c. 25): “qui—affir-
mavit se decumanis plus quam deberet non
daturum.'' ‘ Aratores' was a general
name for the cultivators in the Roman
provinces, whether the provincials them-
selves, or Roman citizenS. These ‘ ara-
tores’ might either be the owners of land,
or the lessees. If the land was let, the
owner was distinguished by the term ‘ do-
minus‚' and the occupier by the term ‘ ara-
tor' (c. 54). In c. 21, one Nympho‘ is
mentioned, and he was a Sicilian, who was
the lessee of a large extent of land (ara-
tiones magnas conductas haberet) ; and
many rich Sicilians were large tenant far-
mers. In another case, the property of a
man’s wife was let to a ‘ colonus ς’ and this
‘colonus’ was of course an ‘arator' (c.
22). Again (c. 40), “ Diocles Panhormi-
tanus—arabat agrum conductum in Seges-
tano 3³³ a man of Panhormus was the
lessee of lands in the territory of Segeste,
in which it appears that persons who were
not Segestani could not acquire the owner-
ship of land. The ‘decumani‚' as already
explained, were those ‘ publicani’ who
farmed the ‘ decumae,' and the chief
among the ‘ publicani' (Lib. 2. 0. 71).
