ACT. II. LIBER QUARTUS. 481

XXXII. Vobis autem, judices, quid hoc indignius aut quid
, minus ferendum videri potest? Verresne habebit domi suae cande·
labrum J ovis e‘ gemmis auroque perfectum? Cujus fulgore collu-
cere atque illustrari J ovis Optimi Maximi templum oportebat, id
apud istum in ejusmodi conviviis constituetur quae domesticis stu-
pris flagitiisque flagrabunt P In istius lenonis turpissimi domo
simul cuni ceteris Chelidonis hereditariis ornamentis Capitolii orna-
menta ponentur? Quid huic sacri unquam fore aut quid religiosi
fuisse putatis qui nunc tanto scelere se obstrictum esse non sentiat Ρ
qui in judicium veniat, ubi ne precari quidem J ovem Optimum
Maximum atque ab eo auxilium petere more omnium possit P a quo
etiam dii immortales sua repetunt in eo judicio quod hominibus ad
suas res repetendas est constitutum. Miramur Athenis Minervam,
Deli Apollinem, J unonem Sami, Pergae Dianam, multos praeterea
ab isto deos tota Asia Graeciaque violatos, qui a Capitolio manus
abstinere non potuerit? Quod privati homines de suis pecuniis
ornant ornaturique sunt, id G. Verres ab regibus ornari non pas-
sus est. Itaque hoc nefario scelere concepto nihil postea tota in
Sicilia neque sacri neque religiosi duxit esse: ita sese in ea prc-
vincia per triennium gessit ut ab isto non solum hominibus verum
etiam diis immortalibus bellum indictum putaretur.‘

XXXIII. Segesta est oppidum pervetus in Sicilia, judices, quod

32. repetunt. . repetendas] A play on the
title of the Lex de Repetundis, under
which Verres was tried.-—‘ Miramur Athe-
nis’ &c. : see Lib. 1. c. 17, Sto.

neque sac-ri . . duxit esse .·] There is the
same use of ‘duxit’ in Lib. 5. e. 55.—
‘sacri “. . religiosi’ refer to the Roman
division of things. The first division is
into things ‘divini juris’ and ‘humani
juriS,’ things appropriated to the gods and
things appropriated to man. 'rho things
‘divini juris' were (livided into ‘sacrae'
and ‘religiosae :’ “Sacrae sunt qnae diis
superis consecratae sunt: religiosae quac
diis manibus relictae sunt '’ (Gaius, ii.

323. Segesta] One of the ‘civitates
liberae ’ (Lib. 3. c. 6). Cicero here adopts
the popular notiou of Aeneas having come
from Troy to Italy, and he makes him
found Segesta on his way. There was
certainly a tradition that the· place was
founded by Asiatic colonists. Thucydides
(vi. 2) says, that some of the Trqjans having
ssed from the Achaei upon the capture of
Troy sailed to Sicily, and settled close to
the Sicani, the old inhabitants of the island,

and the two peoples got the common nanie
of Elpni, and their cities were Eryx and
Egesta. The Roman form of the name is
always Segesta, as it appears. The Greek
form on the older coins is Segesta, and on
the later coins and in our Greek MSS. it
is Egesta. It was the Roman tradition
that Acestes, who gave his name to the
city, and was horn in Sicily of a Trojan
mother, was assisted hy Aeneas iu the
founding of the city. There was a temple
os Aeneas at Segesta (Dion. Halic. i. 53).
The Romans, after their usual fas-bion,
were politic enough to encourage, or to
invent the supposed relationship during
their contest with the Carthaginians iu
