184 EDICTA MAGISTRATUUM.

were published by those Magistratus who had J urisdictio: they con-
tained the general rules by which they would be guided during their
administration. They were written out on a tablet of a white ground
(album), and put up in a public place, in such a position that any body
could read thern (unde de plano recte legi possent). The earliest
Edictum that relates to the administration of justice is that of Cn.
Flavius Aedilis Curulis in which he published the Dies Fasti. Thes
Edictiones Aediliciae, which related to sales in the open market, are
mentioned by Plautus'(Captiv. iv. 2. 43) ⁷. Cicero mentions the Edict
of the Praetors as long in use before his time (In Verr. Act. i. c. 44) ;
and in another passage (De Invent. ii. 22), where he is describing the
nature of custom or usage (consuetudo), he says that custom compre-
hends many rules of law (jura) which are now certain or fixed by reason
of their antiquity. And he adds, “of this kind there are many other
rules of law3 and by much the largest part of those which the Praetors
are accustomed to publish in their edict (edicere).” Cicero here dis-
tinctly declares that the Praetor declared by his Edict that which he
found established by usage: he gave to usage the form and character of
real law. The Praetor Urbanus and Peregrinus published Edicta, which
were called Urbana, by way of distinction from the Edicta published by
Provincial governors, which were called Provincialia.

It became then the practice at Rome for those who had the Jus
Edicendi (Graius, i. 2. 6), and particularly the Praetors, not merely to
publish Edicta during their year of office, as the occasion might arise,
but also to publish Edicta upon entering on their office. These Edicta
contained general rules, in accordance with which the Praetor declared
that he would administer justice during the year. These Edicta were
called Perpetua, because they had an enduring force, like the office of
him who published them. This word Perpetuuxn has been the subject
of some difference of opinion. lt means continuous‚ uninterrupted3
and it ina-y refer both to the continuity of the office of Praetor, and also

to the continuity of the Edictum during the year of a Praetor's office3 ’

for it seems that we can speak of the Perpetuum Edictum of any parti-
cular Praetor. It is at least certain that the term Perpetuum had no
reference to the permanence of the rules contained in the Edict‚ for
these rules were only valid during the office of him who declared them
(In Verr. Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 42, ‘legem annuam’): they might be adopted
01· rejected by his successor. If a Praetor made an Edictum for a tem-
porary occasion, it is generally stated that such an Edictum was called

there is an example of an Edict‚ the first part of which refers to a particular case, aud

the latter part of which is general.
