324 IN O. VERREM

non modo arationes relinqueret, sed etiam ex Sicilia profugeret
Romamque una cum multis ab isto ejectis veniret. Fecit ut
decumanus Nymphonem negaret ex edicto praeclaro, quod nullam
ad aliam rem nisi ad hujusmodi quaestus pertinebat, numerum
jugerum professum esse. Nympho quum se vellet aequo judicio
defendere, dat iste viros optimos recuperatores, eundem illum
medicum Cornelium—is est Artemidorus Pergaeus qui in sua ,
patria dux isti quondam et magister ad spoliandum Dianae tem-
plum fuit—et haruspicem Volusium, et Valerium praeconem.
Nympho antequam plane constitit condemnatur. Quanti fortasse
quaeritis. Nulla erat edicti poena certa. Frumenti ejus omnis
quod in areis esset. Sic Apronius decumanus non decumam
debitam, non frumentum remotum atque celatum, sed tritici septem
millia medimnum ex Nymphonis arationibus edicti poena, non
redemptionis aliquo jure tollit.

and paid a fixed rent. It was not the
metayer system. Cicero speaks of them as
rich, and farming ‘magna impensa mag-
noque instrumento? ‘ with a great outlay,
and a large tarining-st0(·k.’ ‘ Conductas ³
means the contract of ‘locatio et conduc-
tio? of which ‘merces,’ or a money pay-
ment, is as essential a part as ‘pretium’
(price) is in buying and selling. Gaius (iii.
142), “locatio autem et conductio simili-
bus regulis constituuntur ι nisi enim merces
certa statuta sit, non videtur locatio et
conductio contrahi.'' See also Gaius, Dig.
19. 2. 2.

Artemidorus Pergaeus] It seems that
this Artemidorus had been made a Roman
citizen, as we may infer from his name,
Cornelius. Cicero alludes to this part of
the plundering of Verres in Lib. 1. c.

acl spoliandum] V. The common read-
ing is ‘ ad despoliandum.'

Frumenti] Ι make this the beginning
of a new sentence. It is the answer to
‘ Quanti fortasse quaeritis?

‘non redemptionis uffa] ‘not by any
right that he had as undertaker.' I prefer
using a genuine word, which expresses the
meaning well, though with us in England
it is now generally applied to one pecu-
liar kind of undertaking. A ‘decumanus ³
was said ‘redimere' or ‘conducere' the
‘decumae’ (c. 30),· he could also bc said
‘emere,' the reason of which has been
already explained c. 61.

22. Menatem] The safest orthography

seems to bc ‘ Menaeni,’ though the MSS.
have ‘ Meneni‚’ and ‘ Moneni,' except V,
which has ‘ Menaeni.' But, as Zumpt ob-
serves, and the remark is worth noting,
to prevent MSS. being cited where the
citation is not applicable, in the MSS.
very often ae diphthongus is represented
by simple e, especially in foreign names.
The form on the coins is ΜΕΝΑΙΝΩΝ. The
place is called Μέναινον in Diodorus (xi.
7 8), but the usual Greek form is Μέναι.
The place is now Mineo, west of Leontini.

fundus] A ‘ fundus ' is an estate in
land 3 a piece of laud as a whole. A ‘ fun-
dus' was often designated in Italy by some
name, as ‘ Sempronianus?

This ‘fundus’ was the property of Xeno's
wife, and was let (locatus) to a ‘colonusf
The word ‘ colonuS,’ if we explain the term
according to Roman usage, means the lessee
of a farm. He who lets the use of a thing
is ‘locat0r.’ He who promises money for
the use of a thing (conductor) is ‘inqui-
linus? if the thing let is a house or lodg-
ings. lf it is a piece of cultivable ground,
the ‘ conductor ³ is called ‘ colonus? Gaius,
Dig. 19. 2. 25. ξ 1, “qui fundum fruendum
vel habitationem alicui locavit, si aliqua ex
causa fundum vel aedes vendat, curare de-
bet ut apud emptorem quoque eadem pac-
tione et colono frui et inquilino habitare
liceat ; alioquin prohibitus is aget eum eo
ex eonductoss’ The annual payment agreed
on was ‘ pensio.' Sometimes there was an
agreement for the division of the produce,
in which case the ‘ colonus’ was called ‘par-
