SICILY A ROMAN PROVINCE. 637

hormus‚ and Agrigentum. Pliny’s remarks on the ‘ conventus ' of the
Spanish Peninsula (Lib. 3. c. 1) will explain this. Hispania Baetica was
. divided into four ‘juridici conventus,' or circuits for the administration
of justice. The province of Citerior Hispania was divided into seven
‘ conventus.' In speaking of the ‘ conventus Carthaginiensis,' Pliny uses
the expression ‘Carthaginem conveniunt populi LXV? and in another
place he speaks of certain Celtici as belonging to the ‘ Hispalensis con-
ventus,’ or circuit of Seville3 and of the Turduli as those ‘ qui jura Cor-
dubam petunt :’ all which are only different modes of expressing the
same thing. The governor made his circuits through the island, and he
probably visited not only the chief place in each ‘ conventus,’ but other
towns also (Lib. 2. c. 70). Among the Comites, or those who formed
the body of functionaries attached to the praetor, ‘ praefecti ’ are men-
tioned (Lib. 2. c. 10); and the ‘praefecti’ appear to have been em-
ployed in the administration of justice (Lib. 3. c. 32, and the note on
‘ praefecti nomine ’).

There were two quaestors for the island, one for the western part, or
the district of Lilybaeum (⁶ is qui Erycum montem obtinebat? Lib. 2.
e. 8) ; and one for the eastern division, or that- of Syracuse. The func-
tions of the quaestors were the same in Sicily as in other provinces. It
is stated in one passage (Lib. 2. c. 8) that it was the practice of the
quaestor of Lilybaeum to sue for any thing that became (lue to the
temple of Eryx. (See also Divin. c. 17.)

Cicero's statement is, that the Sicilian towns (Lib. 3. c. 6) were sub-
ject to Rome on the same terms on which they had been governed before
the island became a province. The statement may be correct so sar as
concerns the towns which were under Hicro’s government, but it is rather
deficient in precision, if we apply his language to all the towns of the
island, for Hiero’s kingdom comprised only a part of Sicily. However,
as a general remark, the statement is intelligible enough. Seventeen
cities are mentioned (Lib. 5. c. 47) as having been faithful to the
Romans in all the Punic and Sieilian wars. One of these was Tyndari&
which however is not mentioued among either the Civitates Focdcratao
or the Immunes ac Liberae. The number of sicilian citios, says Cicero,
which were subducd by the Romans, was very small (Lib. 3. c. 6). The
lands of these cities became the property of the Roman people by con-
quest3 but the lands were restored: subject to the payment of certain
dues, which dues were let to sarm by the consors at Rome (censorin,
locatio ¹). These are the Censoriae Civitates of Zumpt’s list, which
is printed at the end of Excursus IX.; but I do not vouch for the
aceuracy of the list. None of the citios of Sicily paid a fixed land-
