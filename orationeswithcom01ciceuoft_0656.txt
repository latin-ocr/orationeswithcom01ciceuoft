636 SICILY A ROMAN PROVINOE.

as it was iu the legal system of the Romans, and as it is in modern
Europe. .

The Lex Rupilia (Lib. 2. c. 13) made regulations sor the constitution
of the courts by which civil questions were to be tried. In the system
of Greek colonization every city had its own constitution and laws:
each was a perfect, independent community. The Greek towns of
Sicily, which were of various origin, had a great diversity of custcms,
and most of these customs were retained under Roman dominion. Thus
Cicero remarks of the Thermitani (Lib. 2. c. 37), that in consideration
of their fidelity to the Romam, the senate and the Roman people
restored to them their city, lands, and laws (leges). This favour was
probably granted on the conquest of the island, and confirmed by the
Lex Rupilia. Sthenius of Thermae was charged with falsifying the
public records (de literis publicis corruptis), which was a crixninal
offence3 and yet even in this case he maintained that the Roman
praetor had no authority, and he claimed to be tried by the law of his
own city. The ‘ procuratores’ of Epicrates of Bidis, a small town, in
the case of his title to a succession (hereditas) being disputed by the
‘palaestritae ' of Bidis, claimed to have the matter tried according to
their own law (leges suae), or at any rate according to the Lex Rupilia.
Cicero (Lib. 2. c. 13) has explained the general rules applicable to suits
between Sicilians, and between Sicilians and Romans. He says that
between two Sicilians of the same ‘ civitas ’ the matter was decided
according to the law of the place3 and a citizen of the place was ‘judex ’
(Lib. 2. c. 27). If the parties to the suit were of different states, the
praetor appointed (sortitus est) ‘judices ’ pursuant to the Lex Rupilia.
Cicero does not say more of this matter than his purpose required. The
Lex Rupilia, as he informs us, fixed the constitution of the court which
was to try a matter between citizens of different states3 and it probably
also contained some regulations as to the rules of law applicable to such
cases3 for as these states had their several laws, it would be necessary to
determine in some general way at least what rules of law should prevail
when there was a conflict between those of different states. Other
cases, which are provided for, are mentioned by Cicero (Lib. 2. c. 13).
All disputes between the ‘ aratores ' or cultivators and the ‘ decumani ’
or Publicani, who farmed the ‘ decumae,' were to be settled according to
the regulations of King Hiero II. (Lex Hieronica.)

For the purposes of administration Sicily was divided into ‘ conventus '
or districts, so called from the people of a given district meeting at a
fixed place for the purpose of having their suits heard and determined,
and for the transaction of other business which required the authority of
the praetor. Sicily appears to have been divided into four ⁶ conventus’
at least (Lib. 2. c. 36 3 Lib. 5. c. 11), those of Syracuse, Lilybaeum, Pan-
