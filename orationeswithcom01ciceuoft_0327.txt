distributed among Roman citizens. After
this land was disposed of, and the ‘por-
toria' were abolished in Italy, there was
no revenue raised in Italy except the ‘vice-
sima‚’ from the sale and manumission of
slaves (Cic. Ad Att. ii. 163 Dion Cassius,
xxxviii. 1, &c., ed. Reimarus).

The Roman ‘ pignoris capio ' or ‘ captio,'
and the English ‘ distress,' were, in many
cases, the same process. Property of the
person who owes a duty is seized, audit be-
comes in the condition of property pledged.
The owner must pay the demand, and then
heis entitled to have his property back.
Klotz absurdly supposes that when the pro-
perty was seized the owner must proceed by
aetion to rccover it, whereas, if he pays the
money, he is entitled to have it- back. Of
course, if it is not given back, hc must sue
for it. This process was in use, as we see
from this passage, in Cicero's time, for the
recovery ofthe ‘vectigalia’ 111 the provinces,
and also in Italy. 111 the time of Gaius
this practice of distress no longer ex-
isted, and the Publicani were required
to proceed by action for the recovery of
what was due. But the ‘intentio ’ in this
case contained a fiction, in which mention
was made of the old process: Gaius (iv.
32), “in ca forma, quac publicano propo-
nitur, talis fictio est, ut quanta pecnnia.
olim, si pignus captmn esset, id pignus is a
quo captum erat luere deberet, tantam pe-
cuniam condemnetur.'' A Rescript of M.
Antoninus and 1.. Verus declared that the
proceedings for the reeovery of ⁴ vectigalia'
should be against the land (praedia), which
thus became liable for arrears in the hands
of any person who was in possession of it
(Dig. 39. 4. 7).

The ‘pignoris capio ’ was an old Roman
institution. (Gaius, iv. 27 ; Gellius, vii.

10.) Gaius says (iv. 28), “item lege . . .
data est pignoris captio publicanis vectiga-
lium publicorum populi Romani adversus
eos qui aliqua lege vectigalia deberent.''
The name of the ‘lex' which gave this
power is not legible in the Verona MS.
except the termination ‘toria.' In the
time of Gaius, as already observed, this
particular ‘pignoris capio' no longer ex-
isted.

The ‘pignoris capio' was also employed by
the ‘magistratus’ to compel obedience to
their orders, or to enforce the discharge of
some public duty : the thing taken in such a
case could only be recovered by the pay-
ment of a sum of money. It was also one
of the modes of execution, by which a
man’s goods were seizcd when he did not
satisfy a judgment, aud they were sold
within two months for the beuetit of the
creditum but this process belongs to a
period after Cicero's time, aud to the reign
of Antoninus Pius (big. 42. 1. 15, 31).

The nature of ί111311·633,’ 111 the English
system, is well explained iu the article
‘⁶ l)istress,’' in the l'enny Cyclopaedia.

The MSS. reading is ‘ petitor ac piguera-
tor,’ but Lg. -1-22. p. 111. 11113 ‘aut.’ There

pose that the Publicanus might proceed
by action to recover what was due to him,
as well as by disti-essu Iordan 11113 “ ac?

sintqulis juyis] The MSS„ except Lg.
42 and V, have ⁸ in singulis jugis ς’ but in
6. 51 we have ‘minus multis jugisss where
‘jugum ' means a pair of beasts. In this
passage it means those who plough with a
single pair, small cultivators. Orelli has
‘ in singulis jugis?

recuperatorio] The ‘judiees ' in such a
trial would be ‘ recuperatores! See Divin.
