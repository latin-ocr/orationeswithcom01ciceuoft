Quid est hoc ⁶? Sponsio fit de capite ac fortunis tuis: tu sedes et
quiescis? non persequeris? non perseveras Ρ non perquiris cui dix-
erit Apronius, quis audierit, unde hoe natum, quemadmodum pro-

dictitare te sibi esse socium, commoveri te oportuit, evocare Apro-
nium, nec illum ante tibi satisfacere quam tu omnium existimationi
satisfecisses. Quum vero in foro celeberrimo tanta frequentia hoo

unquam tantam plagam tacitus accipere potuisses, nisi hoc ita
statuisses in re tam manifesta quidquid dixisses te deterius esse
facturum P Quaestores, legatos, praefectos, tribunos suos multi
missos fecerunt et de provincia decedere jusserunt, quod illorum

58. non aliqua 15⁵0] “ Codd. non aliqua
re simul. populi Rom. existimationi se lio-
minum, item 510 editiones veteres, et prae-
terea vendicasset s. vindicasset. Victor.'’
(Zumpt.) Manutius struck out ‘populi
Rom. ς’ but he kept ‘ vindicasset-³ Gruter
first gave the text as it stands in Zumpt's
edition and in this. The reading is very
uncertain. Iordan says nothing about it.
‘ Venditare se ' is explained by Forcellini as
equivalent to ‘ ostentare‚' ‘ to make a show
or display.' The text means “ simulata
aliqua virtute studere efficere ut homines
bene de te existiment ’³ (Graevius).

tu sedes dfe] If the reader will omit
the notes of interrogation after ‘quiescis'
and the other words in this sentence, he
will not miss them.

prolatum sit Ζ] Here the word is used
in its ordinary sense, ‘to bring forward?
See Lib. 2. 0. 30, where Klotz has ‘ pro-
lato ' for ‘ dilato' in a 501150 111 which ‘pro-
lato' can also be used: Pro Muren. c. 13,
‘ prolatis rebus 3' and Ad Att. xiv. 5, ‘ res
prolatas?

tribunos suos] He means ‘ tribuni mili-
tum? See Pro P. Sestio, 0. 3, note on ‘ ab·
stinentia.’——‘ missos fecerunt ι’ similar to
‘ reliquum fecerunt ³ 0. 57, and other like
usages of ‘facere’ (c. (30). In other lan-
guagcs also we observe that some particular
words are made to (10 a great deal of work.
The Italian ‘ fare,' ¹ind particularly the

French ‘faire,' are worked harder than
their Latin parcnt.

minus commode audire] The good re-
port of the governor of a province, his good
name, was a matter that concerned him
nearly. Cicero says to his brother, when
he was governor of Asia (Ad Q. Fr. i. 1),
“ ac si te ipse vehementius ad onmes partes
bene audiendi excitaris.'' It appears from
this passage that a governor could send
away his ‘quaestors' and others from the
province.—‘ illorum culpa,’ adopted by
Zumpt from the better MSS. Orelli's
reading is ‘eorum culpa? and ‘eorum' is
the proper word simply to express a re-
ference to persons; but Cicero means to
speak of ‘ these persons ³ emphatieally.
Again, Orelli has ‘peccare illos ς’ but the
best MSS. have ‘ peccare ipsos? where ‘ip-
sos' refers specially to the ‘illos' These
are not slight matters in the text of Latin
authors. The right use of the pronouns is
one of the great niceties of the language.

animam] This scandalous abuse is in
the style of the Roman orators. It is an
unsavoury allusion to the foul breath of
Apronius. ‘ Animus,' the intellectual and
moral existence, is herc contrasted with
the brcath, as in Juvenal (xv. 148) with
the life :

——d “indulsit communis conditor illis
Tantum animas, nobis animum quoque.’'
