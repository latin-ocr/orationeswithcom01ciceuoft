622 IN C. VERREM
longe alia mihi lege in hac civitate et conditione vivendum est.
Venit mihi in mentem M. Catonis, hominis sapientissimi et vigilan-
tissimi, qui quum sc virtute, non genere, populo Romano commen-
dari putaret, quum ipse sui generis initium ac nominis ab se gigni
et propagari vellet, hominum potentissimorum suscepit inimicitias
et maximis in laboribus usque ad summam senectutem summa cum
gloria vixit. Postea Q. Pompeius, humili atque obscuro loco natus,
nonne plurimis inimicitiis, maximisque suis periculis acv laboribus
amplissimos honores est adeptus P Modo O. Fimbriam, O. Marium,
O. Caelium vidimus non mediocribus inimicitiis ac laboribus con-
tendere ut ad istos honores pervenirent, ad quos vos per ludum et
per negligentiam pervenistis. Haec eadem est nostrae rationis
regio et via: horum nos hominum sectam atque instituta perse-
quimur.

LXXI. Videmus quanta sit in invidia quantoque in odio apud
quosdam nobiles homines novorum hominum virtus et industria3 si
tantulum oculos dejecerinius, praesto esse insidias3 si ullum locum
aperuerimus suspicioni aut crimini, accipiendum statim vulnus esse 3
semper nobis vigilandum, semper laborandum videmus. Inimicitiae

difficulties which a man of mean origin had
111 attaining the honours of the state, the
‘ populi Romani bcneficia,’ compared with
the facilities ofthose of noble family. Rome
contained a compact and powerful aristo-
cratic class, who, in spite of any 1·ivah·y
among themselves, agreed to keep down
their plebeian opponents and to secure to
themselves all the high offices. So it is in
every country in which such an aristocratic
class exists. The mcmbers of it are thrust
into places without an effort of their own ς
they may sleep and yawn, and still have
their pockets filled with money and their
pride gratified by distinction, while 1311013110-
rious plebeian must work his way upwards
without help and against opposition. A
countryman of Cicero, C. Marius, 3 native
of Arpinum, is represented by Sallust
(Bell. J ug. c. 85, &c.) complaining in
similar ternis of the arrogance of the nobi-
lity, who attempted to engross all the
honours of the state, and of the difficulty
which the plebeian had in attaining them,
whatever might be his merit: “ queis nobi-
litas freta, ipsa dissimilis moribus, nos illo-
rum aemulos contemnit ; et 01111105 honores
non ex merito sed quasi debitos a vobis
repetit.” Comp. Cic. Ad Attic. i. 2 ,- and
De leg. Agr. ii. c. 1, 2.

M. Catonis,] Cato the Censor, whom
Cicero has innnortalized in his treatise Dc

Senectute. He was a native of the muni-
cipium Tusculum, and the first of his family
who raised himself to the ranks of the
Roman nobility.

Q. Pompeius,] Cicero proceeds to men-
tion other Romans who raised themselves
from a mean condition to the highest ‘ho-
nores' Q. Pompeius Rufus was consul Rc.
111, with Cn. Servilius Caepio. He is com-
memorated by Cicero as 311 orator of some
distinction (Brutus, c. 25): “ qui summos
honores homo per se cognitus sine ulla
commendatione majorum est adeptus.”

Cicero next speaks of those whom he had
seen himself. C. Flam'us Fimbria, consul
B.C. 104, with C. Marius, who was then
consul for the fourth time. He is men-
tioned by Cicero (Brutus, c. 34) among the
Roman orators as ‘ti-uculentuS, asper,male-
dicus?

This C. Caelius was C. Caelius Caldus,
consul B.c. 91⁴, the first of his family who
attained this honour. He was also an ora-
tor, though of no great distinction. ‘Caelius'
and other words of the kind are variously
written. The inferior MSS. have ‘ Celius.’
The coins have ‘ Coelius ' or ‘ Coilius?

per ludum] Or, as Cicero elsewhere ex-
presses it, ‘ quasi ludibundi?

regio et vicu] ‘ (111-0011011 31111 road.' See
c. 68.
