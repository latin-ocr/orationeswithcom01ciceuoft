434 FORMULA OCTAVIANA.

the injured party complete compensation, and to take · from third
persons a profit or advantage, which they have got without good
grounds, and at the cost of him who has suffered ⁶ vis et metus.’ The
ignorance in a third party of the unlawful act was not a necessary
condition of the plaintiff’s right of action. The principle was the same
as that applied to stolen goodS, where the ownership still remained
unchanged‚ into whatever hands the stolen thing came. Accordingly,
a ‘ bonae fidei emptor‚’ that is, a man who believed that the seller had a*
good title, if he bought things from a person who had got them ‘ vi et
nietu,' or if he received such things as a gift, or as a legacy, was still
liable to this action for restitution (Dig. 4. 2. 14. ξ 5).

The Octaviana Formula further agrees with the Litis Aestimatio as
to the fourfold value to be recovered3 whether this fourfold value first
appeared in the Lex Juha, and was thence transferred to the Formula,
or whether it was in the Lex Cornelia, and was thence transferred into
the Formula at its original formation, as in the case of the ‘actio vi
bonorum,' where the ‘ quadruplum ’ was a part of the original Formula4.

The object of the ‘ quadruplum ’ seems to have been rather an indirect
means of compelling ‘ restitutio ’ than the proper object of the ‘Actio
quod metus causa 3⁷ and accordingly the right to demand the ‘quadru-
plum’ was extinguished if the complainant had obtained satisfaction by
the immediate aid of the ‘ praetor,’ by the ‘ exceptio metus,’ or by the
‘actio doli) For if this ‘Actio quod metus ’ had been a mixed penal
action, the claim for the ‘triplum ' would still have remained, after the
‘ simplum ’ was made good ⁵. If one of several persons who has used
‘metus et vis,’ or one of several persons to whose hands the thing had
come, either has restored the thing before judgment pronounced against
him, or has paid the ⁶ quadruplum ’ pursuant to a judgment, the demand
against the rest is extinguished ε the solidarity which is a characteristic
of pena] actions does not hold here ⁶. This rule as to the ‘Actio quod

⁴ Dig. 47. 8. 2 : “ Praetor ait ε Si cui dolo malo hominibus coactis damni quid factum
esse (licetur, sive cujus bona rapta esse dicentur, in eum qui id fecisse dicetur intra
annum quo primuni de ea re experiendi potestas fuerit in quadruplum, post aunum in
simplum judicium dabo.”

⁵ Savigny, system, &e v. 232, 233. In all cases of this kind the second action can
be prosecuted, although the first has been prosecuted and a judgment obtained for the
pla-intiff. Thus the ‘Actio 'ss' bonorum raptorum ' had for its object simple recovery of
the value, and also three times the value as a penalty.

6 “ If several persons steal at the same time, each of them is guilty of the whole act
of theft, and the circumstance that others help a inan in the act of theft neither alters
nor (liminishes the penal character of his act. Accordingly the ‘ furti actio' is main-
tainable against each for the full penalty, even though the rest have already paid their

penalty, because the punishment of each of the several delicts is a separate and distinct
object.'' Saviguy‚ System, dac. v. 234.
