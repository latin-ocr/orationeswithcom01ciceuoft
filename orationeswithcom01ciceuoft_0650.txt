Coloniae] The five coloniae are Tauromenium, Catina, Syracusae, Thermaesand
Tyndaris. Diodorus says that there were sixty-eight eities in Sicily, which number
agrees with that of the five colonies and sixty-three cities in this text of Pliny. P. Ma-
nutius (Lib. 3. e. 50, note) says that there were seventy-two cities in Sicily, according
to Pliny. Ι suppose that 110 found this number in his text of Pliny.

Messana] It was made a colonia of Roman citizens after Cicero's time, but the date
of the establislnnent is not known. It is stated that the coins struck under Augustus
have the legend ‘ Messenion ³ in Roman characters, which indicates that the peoplc were
then Cives Romani.

Tauromenium] Naxos, the first Greek settlement in the island (Thucyd. vi. 3), was
destroyed before Cicero's time, and Tauromenium was built near the site of Naxos
(Diodor. xvi. 7) It was made a Roman colony by Augustus, as it seems.

Asines] Harduin in his note assumes this to 110 the Assinarus of Thucydides (vii.
84), which is a mistake. The Asines, or whatever its true name may be, is placed by
Pliny near Tauromenium 3 but the Assinarus was south of Syracuse. This Asines
appears to be the Acesines of Thucydides (iv. 25), and apparently the same that Appian
(Bell. Civ. v. 109) calls Onobalas.

Catina] This is said to be the reading of all the MSS. The Greek name is always
Κατάνῃ, of which the Romans made Catina, as they made Massilia of Μασσαλία. The
Roman colony sent to Catina is mentioned by Strabo (p. 268, ed. Cas.).

Leontini] This town was in the rich corn country north of Syracuse. In Cieero’s
time it was a poor place.

Megaris] The genuine name appears to be Megara, a town near the coast between
the Terias and the Anapus. This Megara (Steph. Byz. v. Μέγαρα) was originally named
Hybla. There were three eities in Sicily named Hybla. This was the Little Hybla, as
Stephanus (v. “Τβλα) calls it, and he names the people Ὕβλαΐοι Γαλεῶται Μεγαρεῖς.

Syracusae] This place received a Roman colony 111 the time of Augustus, as we learn
from Strabo (p. 270) and Dion Cassius (Lib. 54. c. '7).

Elorum] This word was probably written both without the aspirate and with it,
like Enna and Henna. Pliny mentions only the river, but there was a town Helorum
or Helorus on the river.

Camarina] This town is not mentioned by Cicero. It was decayed long before his
time. 'When Pliny and Ptolemy speak of it, they cannot mean more than to say that
there was once a town on the site.

Gelas] The name occurs on an old coin < ΕΛΑΣ, which bears ahuman head bearded
attached to the fore part of a bull. Gela was founded by Rhodian and Cretan colonists
(Thucyd. vi. 4). '

Thermae] Thermae Selinuntiae.. This place was the hot springs, near the coast,
between Heraclea and Selinus, aud now called Sciacca. It has been suggested that
Pliny has made a mistake in calling this Thermae a colonia, and that 110 should have
named Himera on the north coast, which was a colonia.

’ Selinus] An old Greek coin has the legend ΣΕΛΙΝΟΣ, which is equivalent to
Σελινοῦς.
