648 “NON MODO,” &cn

traitor, but not even a deserter has ever found a place in my camp.''
But I do not think that this is a good form of translation.

Professor Key (Grammar, ξ 1145) observes that the “negative in
‘ne . . quidem‚' when followed by a common predicate, often extends
its influence over a preceding clause beginning with ‘ non modo.⁷ ”f He
gives the following instance and translation :—-

“ Assentatio non modo amico sed ne libero quidem digna est” (Cic.) :
‘ flattery is unworthy not merely of a friend, but even of a free man.’ ,

He adds in a note: “It is in such passages as these that ‘ non modo ²
is said to be used for ‘non modo non.' ’⁷ The predicate contained in
‘digna’ is placed at the end of the sentence, but it applies equally to
both parts of it; and the ‘non modo’ expressed to a Roman clearly
enough, that what was going to be predicated was not limited to friend,
but, as the next words show, extended even to a free man.

‘Non solum ' is used in the same way, as in the following example
from the sanie Grainmar: “ Senatui non solum juvare rem publicani, sed
ne lugere quidem licuit :’' ‘the senate were forbidden not merely to
assist, but even to mourn over their country.’

In Lib. 3. c. 5, there is “ ut eum facile non modo extra tectum, sed
ne extra lectum quidem quisquan] videret,” which is anot'her of these
supposed examples of‘non modo ’ for ‘non modo non3’ and there are
many other examples in these orations. But the supplying of another
‘ non ' after the ‘ non modo,' and in the clause to which ‘non modo ’
belongs, is contrary to the usage of the Latin language in such cases.

In the following instances however there is a double negative in the
first clause, and yet there is ‘ ne . . quidem‚' with the general predicate,
in the second clause :—

Lib. 3. c. 48.—“ multis autem non modo granum nullum sed ne paleae quidem . . relin-

querentur.”
Lib. 4. c. 22.—“ non niodo oppidum nullum, sed ne domus quidem ulla paulo locupletior

expers hujus injuriae reperietur.”

These are instances of the double negative, as it is called, the repe-
tition of the negative, to give emphasis: “Not to speak of towns, of
not a single town being exempt, I add, not even will a, single house of
the richer class be found to have escaped this wrong.'’ Compare Lib. 2.
c. 46: “ quod non modo Siculus nemo sed ne Sicilia quidem tota po-
tuisset.’' ln the Pro S. Roscio Am. c. 52, there is “in quo non modo
culpa nulla, sed ne suspicio quidem potuit consistere 3⁹² but in the Pro
Murena, c. 33, Cicero writes “frequentiam in isto officio gratuitam non
niodo dignitati ullius unquam, sed ne voluntati quidem defuisse,” and
here no various reading is mentioned by the last editors of these

orfflpenzllowing case is different from those just given (Lib. 5. c. 18) :
