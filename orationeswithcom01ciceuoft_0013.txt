PREFAOE. . vii

As Ι have often referred to the MSS„ the following extract
from Zumpt may be useful. His conclusion is this :

Sic hoc fere stemma codicum MSS. nascitur

 

Cod. Antiquus deperditus. cod. Vatican. rescriptus.
Nann. Fabrie. (Metell.) Par. 7774 A s. Regius
libr. ii. et iii. (coll. Havn.) libr. iv. et v.
Lag. 42. pr. ⁵m. in illis libr. Ι
Par. A. . . . Erfurt . . . Par. B. Lag. 29.

Par. D. (Steph.) Cuiac.

Guelf. 2. Leid.
(Memmiani Lamb.) Guelf. 1. Vulgares.

Fabric. and Metell. are the same MS. Par. 7774 A is the same
as Regius. Ι am net sure that Zumpt always agrees with him-
self about the value of Lag. 29. In a note on Lib. 3. e. 76, he
calls Lag. 29. 42. Paris A. B. “quatuor meliores nostri.'' In
another place (Lib. 5. c. 46), he calls Lag. 29, “minime fidelis ;''
and again (Lib. 4. e. 37), he calls it “infidelis quamvis ex

 

fidelissimo ductus.'’

The edition of Cicero's orations by Klotz, to which Ι have
often referred, is in three vols. 8vo, with notes in German. At
the foot of the page he has given the variations of Orelli’s
edition. In his Preface to the second volume (Leipzig, 1837),
which contains the Verrine orations, the editor explains what
he has done for the text. He states that he owes much to a
eareful examination of the vatican fragments published by Mai.
Ι have noted some of the chief variations in the text of Klotz,
except in the 'fifth book of the Verrines, where I have notieed

very few.

For the second book of the Verrines‚ Ι made use of the
notes to the edition by F. Creuzer and G. H. Moser, Gottingen,
1847. The occasional references in the notes to this edition will
show how far I am indebted to Oreuzer and Moser. Their eom—
mentary is copious‚ and sometimes useful.

For the fifth book I used-the separate edition of this oration
