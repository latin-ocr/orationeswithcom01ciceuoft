178 EDICTA MAGISTRATUUM

instead of beginning the day with his religious duties'. A Magistratus
could take the auspices, either to ascertain the will of the gods, as to
what he intended to do himself3 or he could take them (de caelo servare)
with reference to what other and inferior EIagistratus were going to do,
and he could prevent their acting by declaring the auspices unfavourable
(obnuntiatio).

But every Magistratus had not this power against another Magistratus.
The Auspicia were Maxima and Minora. Those who had the Maxima*
Auspicia were Magistratus Majores, and the rest were Minores. Consuls,
Praetors, Censors‚ and the extraordinary Magistratus, Dictators and
Interreges, had the Maxima Auspicia, and could prevent the acts of all
other Magistratus who had the Minora Auspicia. Among themselves the
Magistratus Majores, who were ⁶ collegae,’ could hinder the acts of one
another: a Consul could hinder the acts of another Consul 3 and a Censor
of a Censor. But a Consul could not interfere with a Censor, nor a
Censor with a Consul, for the Censors were not ‘ collegae ’ of the Consuls,
nor of the Praetors (Gellius, xiii. 15, 011 the authority of the augur M.
Messala) 3 but the Praetors were ‘ collegae ' of the Consuls. One Tribu-
nus Plebis could declare (obnuntiare) against the act of another, for the
Tribuni Plebis were ‘ collegae.’ The Minores Magistratus were Aediles,
Tribuni Plebis, Quaestores Aerarii, and some others.

The use of the Auspicia originated in a religious conviction3 and it was
retained for political reasons after the religious conviction had lost its
force. In war, and in the administration of justice, the use of the
Auspicia was, in course of time, less regarded3 but it was continued for
the Comitia. Yet the Auspicia still determined the nature of the power
of a Magistratus; and the Imperium and Auspicium went together.
The Imperium of a IlIagistratus was the power by virtue of which he gave
effect to his will. Those who were Magistratus had both Imperium and
Auspicium: he who had Imperium without Auspicium was only Pro-
magistratu, as a Proconsul or a Propraetor, whose Imperium was pro-
longed² after the expiration of the office during which he had the
Auspicium. The Magistratus Minores had the Minora Auspicia, but
no Imperium. WVhatever a Magistratus Major could do by virtue of his

¹ Act. ii. Lib. 1. 40, “qui auspicato‚” &c. This passage is probably not quite free
from ambiguity to us. It seems not to refer to the conduct of Verres after being chosen
Praetor, but immediately before. It comes, however, to nearly the same thing 3 for
Cicero (De Divin. i. 16) sayS, “ nihil fere qnondam majoris rei nisi auspicato ne priva-
tim qnidem gerebatur.” See what one of the best politica] writers has said on the
religion of the Romans: Machiavelli Discorsi sopra le Deche di Tito Livio, i. cap.
11—14.

² Cicero, Ad Q. Fr. i. 1. c. 1, “tibi . . prorogatum imperium.” De Divin. ii. 36,
“ Quam multi anni sunt quum bella a proconsulibus et a propraetoribus administrantur,
qui auspicia non habent.'’
