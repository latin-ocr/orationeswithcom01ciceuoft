152 IN O. VERREM

L. frater ejus causam agebat: aderant amici, propinqui. Dicebat
iste, nisi eum muliere decideretur, in possessionem se ire jussurum.
L. Gellius eausam Liguris defendebat: docebat edictum ejus nou
oportere ad eas hereditates valere quae ante eum praetorem venis-
sent3 si hoc tum fuisset edictum, fortasse Ligurem hereditatem
aditurum non fuisse. Aequa postulatio, summa hominum auetor-
itas pretio superabatur. Venit Romam Ligur: non dubitabat quin„

commovere hominem posset. Domum ad eum venit: rem demon-
strat: quam pridem sibi hereditas venisset docet: quod facile in
eausa aequissima homini ingenioso fuit, multa quae quemvis eom-
movere possent dixit: ad extremum petere coepit ne usque eo
suam auctoritatem despiceret, gratiamque contemneret, ut se tanta
injuria afficeret. Homo Ligurem accusare eoepit qui in re adven-
titia atque hereditaria tam diligens tam attentus esset: debere eum
aiebat suam quoque rationem ducere3 multa sibi opus esse, multa
canibus suis quos circa se haberet. Non possum illa planius com-
memorare quam ipsum Ligurem pro testimonio dicere audistis.

‘libertus ² making a testament and giving
nothing or less than half of 1115 property to
his patron, the praetor's edict gave the pa-
tron the ‘bonorum possessio contra tabulas
‘testamenti' of one half, unless the ‘ libertus'
left behind him as a successor a natural,
that is, a not adopted child. When the
rule as to the 0110 half was introduced, it
does not appear (comp. Gaius, iii. 40) ;
but it was before the enactment of the Lex
Papia Poppaea, which gave greater advan-
tages to patrons in the case of the richer
class of ‘libertis

nisi—decideretur,] ‘unless he came to
some terms with the woman.5 If this
allegation against Verres is true, it shows
that he was dishonest. He who has to de-
clare the laW, cannot impose terms on the
partieS, and punish either of them who does
not comply. It is his business to dec-lare
the law and apply it to the facts of the case.
‘ Decide1·e,' in the sense of ‘ coming to
terms,' ‘settling an affai1·,' occurs often.
See Aet. ii. Lib. 2. 0. 32, and Lib. 3. 0. 48,
‘ decidere liceret.' And comp. ‘ decisione?

said that ‘ he must have respect to himself
also.' Some read ‘sui,’ says Lambinus,
who thinks however that ‘ suam ' is right.
Hotmann cites a like example from Cicero,
‘ duxi meam rationem,' Ad Att. viii. 11. D.
Zumpt says that it is doubtful if ‘suam
rationem' is Latin. But Cicero did not
think so, for he says also (De Off. i. 39),
‘habenda ratio 11011 5113 solum? The
‘canes ³ of Verres are his infel-mers, who
smelled out what was to their master's
profit (c. 513 and Lib. 4. 0. 21, &e.).

Quid enim, Verres,] Ι have removed
the note of interrogation, which is ab-
surdly placed after VerreS. Klotz and
Iordan read ‘Quid est, Verres? utrum
ne,’ &c., after V. They also read ‘Non

ther 011 ‘praetorem urbanum? in ac-
eordance with V. See c. 55, ‘ Pr. Urbis?
