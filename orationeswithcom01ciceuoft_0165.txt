AOT. Π. LIBER PRIMUS. 147

TABVLAE TESTAMENTI NON PROFERENTVR. Quid ait? Se ei da-
turum qui se dicat heredem esse. Quid ergo interest profe-
rantur necne P Si protulerit, uno signo ut sit minus quam ex lege
oportet, non des possessionem: si omnino tabulas non proferet,
dabis. Quid nunc dicam? Neminem unquam hoc postea alium
edixisse? Valde sit mirum neminem fuisse qui istius se similem
dici vellet. Ipse in Siciliensi edicto hoc non habet; exegerat
enim jam mercedem : item ut illo edicto (10 quo ante dixi, in Sicilia
de hereditatum possessionibus dandis edixit idem quod omnes
Romae praeter istum: Ex EDIoTo SICILIENSI: SI DE HEREDITATE
AMBIGITVR . . . .

XLVI. Ac per deos immortales quid est quod (10 1100 (1101
possit P Iterum enim jam quaero abs te, sicut modo in illo capite
Anniano de mulierum hereditatibus, nunc in hoc de hereditatum
possessionibus, cur ea capita in edictum provinciale transferre
nolueris Ρ Utrum digniores homines existimasti eos qui habitabant
in provincia quam nos qui aequo jure uteremur, an aliud Romae
aequum est, aliud in Sicilia? Non enim 1100 potest 1100 1000 (1101

said this, he would have said right. He
who produced a will in which he was made

nobody chose to be called like Verres. But
Verres himself does not include this 1·1110 111

‘heres’ (and he could prove himself to be
testamentary ‘ heres ' in no other way), was
¹’entitled to the ‘possessio.’ The note of
Asconius is unintelligible. The substance
of the matter is, that the edict of Verres,
according to Cicero, was irregular, and
made for a corrupt purpose 3 but when he
got to Sicily, he adopted the usual form,
‘in hereditatum possessionibus dandis? a
form which every praetor at Rome used
except himself, aud which he. deviatcd from
for a corrupt purpose. Zumpt writes ‘ se
ei daturum qui dicat,' &c.‚ but ‘invitus,’
and in obedience to the MSS. Asconius
has ‘ qui se dicat.’

The whole of this matter about the edict
of Verres is difficult to understand, for we
are confused between what ought to have
been the edict of Verres, and what it was.
To understand Cicero, we must take his
statement as to the edict of Verres to he
truc; for, if we do not, we cannot see the
justice of his conclusions. As Cicero repre-
sents the conduct of Verres, the absurdity
of his edictal 1·1110 is apparent. WVhether
Cicero stated every thing correctly‚ is a dif-
ferent mattcr. But his statements and his
wnclusions are consistent.

Quid nunc dicam ,ἶ dc] ‘ What shall Ι
now say Ρ That no other person ever since
made this edict-al rulo? Sti-ange, indeed, if

his Sicilian edict? Orelli omits ‘ hoc ¹ after
‘ unquam? Zumpt adds· it, ‘ fide Lag. 29?
aud lordan. ‘ Strange, indeed‚’ is said
ironically. ‘ Strange, that nobody chose
to be likened to Verres. thy, Verres did
not choose to be like 1110150115 for he
changed the rule iu Sicily)

46. Ae] ‘At,' Orelli 3 but incorrectly, I
think.

capite . . . eapiia] ‘Caput‚’ in this
sense, is equivalcut to ‘ title‚' or ⁴ chapter ς’
for ‘ caput ' was used to express 01ιο of the
divisious of a ‘lex,' which we should call a
section. Cic. De Lege Agr. ii. 6, “ a primo
capite legis usque ad extreuunu ;” aud also
a division or title of the ‘ edictum ;’ Cicero,
Ad Fam. iii. 8, “Romae composui edictum
—diligentissimc scriptum caput est quod
pertinet ad minuendos sumptus civitatum ς
quo in capite sunt quaedam nova, salutaria
civitatibus.'’

habitabant] “ habitant Lg. 29 p. 1n.,
Prisc. ;'’ Iordan, who hus ⁴ hal)itaut.'——
‘ uteremur :' ‘ uterentur’ (Orelli), which is
the suggestion of Hotmaun. But Zumpt
says that there is novuriatiou iu the MSS„
and that the usage of the Latin requires
‘utei·enuu·‚' to agree with ⁸ nos.' ‘Ute-
rentur,' according to Iordan, who accepts
it, is from Priscian.
