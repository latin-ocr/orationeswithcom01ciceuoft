60 ΙΝ Ο. VERREM

constitueret3 hoc erepto praesidio ut nullam sibi rem adjumento
fore arbitraretur.

IV. Etenim quod est ingenium tantum, quae tanta facultas
dicendi aut copia quae istius vitam, tot vitiis flagitiisque convictam,
jam pridem omnium voluntate judicioque damnatam, aliqua ex parte
possit defendere? Cujus ut adolescentiae maculas ignominiasque
praeteream, quaestura, primus gradus honoris, quid aliud habet in
se nisi Cn. Carbonem spoliatum a quaestore suo pecunia publica, κ
nudatum et proditum consulem, desertum exercitum, relictam
provinciam, sortis necessitudinem religionemque violatam? cujus
legatio exitium fuit Asiae totius et Pamphyliae, quibus in pro-
vinciis multas domos, plurimas urbes, omnia fana depopulatus est,
quum in Cn. Dolabellam suum scelus illud pristinum renovavit et
instauravit quaestorium; quum eum cui legatus et pro quaestore
fuisset, et in invidiam suis maleficiis adduxit, et in ipsis periculis non
solum deseruit, sed etiam oppugnavit ac prodidit: cujus praetura
urbana aedium sacrarum fuit publicorumque operum depopulatio,
simul in jure dicundo bonorum possessionumque contra omnium
instituta addictio et condonatio. J am vero omnium vitiorum
suorum plurima et maxima constituit monumenta et indicia in
provincia Sicilia, quam iste per triennium ita [vastavit‚] vexavit,

4. convictam] Zumpt has ‘ conjunc-
tam.' The MSS. are of little authority
here, for ‘ conuictam ³ and ‘coniunctam'
are easily confounded. The sense is ‘ a life
against which there is the ew'dence of so
many crimes and abominations.' The use
of ‘convincere’ and ‘condemnare' in Act. ii.
Lib. 1. c. 1, shows that ‘convictam' may
be the true reading here. Comp. Act. ii.
Lib. 1. c. 9, ‘tam multis testibus convictus.5
⁵ In convictos maleficii servos' (Act. ii. Lib.
5. c. 53) is a different thing. Zumpt shows
that ‘ convictum testimonio, judicio,' &c., is
Cicero's language3 but he maintaius that
‘ vita ³ cannot be ‘ convicta vitiis? but must
be ‘ convicta vitiorum‚’ by something else,
which is expressed in the ablative. But he
is mis-taken. Cacsar (B. G. i. 40) writes
“aut aliquo facinore comperto avaritiam
esse convictam ;” where however many good
. MSS. have ‘ coniunctam? Cicero, Pro P.
Quintio, c. 25, writes, “volo inauditum fa-
cinus ipsius qui id commisit voce convinci.’'

Cn. Carbonem] See Introd.

sortz's necessitudinem effe] See Divin.
c. 19.

depopulatus] ‘ depeculatus ' Orelli.

legatus et pro quaestore] Here two
functious are mentioned, that of ‘ legatus,'

and that of ‘ pro quacstore,' or the office of
‘ quaestor ³ filled by one who was not ‘ quae-
stor! Comp. Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 15. It
seems that a man who had been ‘ quaestor'
might be appointed, without the election of
the people, when from any cause the office
of ‘ quaestor ¹ became vacant in a province.

oppufflzarit] See Introd.

in jure dicundo] These words express
the ‘praetor’s’ office, which was ‘ jus dicere?
Excursus iv. ‘Addictio ’ (see Addicere,
Forcellini, for examples) is the term which
expresses the praetor’s adjudication, that
is, his sentence, by which he gave effect
to the right that he declared. ‘ Condonatio ' ·
means the remitting of the adjudication, or
not making it, when he ought to make it 5
for, when a right is established, it is the duty
of him who declares the law to make such
order as shall give it effect. ‘ Bona ³ is the
most comprehensive Roman term to express
property, to express every thing to which a.
man has any right (Dig. 50. 16. 49) 3 a
term which in this sense has passed into
languages derived from the Roman, and in
a limited legal sense into our own. See
Biens, Comyns, Digest. The Germans have
a better term, ‘ Vermogen?
