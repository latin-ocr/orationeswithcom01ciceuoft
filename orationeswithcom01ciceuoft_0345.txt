homini, judices, honestissimae civitatis honestissimo, non modo
frumenti scitote sed etiam vitae et sanguinis tantum relictum esse

quantum Apronii libido tulit.

Nam vi, malo, plagis adductus est

ut frumenti daret non quantum deberet sed quantum cogeretur.
Sostratus et Numenius et Nymphodorus ejusdem civitatis quum
ex agris tres fratres consortes profugissent, quod iis plus frumenti
imperabatur quam quantum exararant, hominibus coactis in eorum
arationes Apronius venit, omne instrumentum diripuit, familiam

abduxit, pecus abegit.

Postea quum ad eum Nymphodorus venis-

set Aetnam et oraret ut sibi sua restituerentur, hominem corripi
ac suspendi jussit in oleastro quodam, quae est arbor, judices,

sed etiam vitae] V omits ‘ etiam,' and
Klotz and Iordan also follow it.

non quantum deberet] Klotz has pre-
ferred the reading of V, ‘non quantum
vellet,’ which makes a contrast between
‘vellet’ and ‘cogeretur.' But a man's
will could not be the measure of his duty.
It is not unjust for a man to be compelled
to pay more than he would choose to pay,
but it is unjust to be compelled to pay
more than he owes. The old reading,
which Orelli has, is ‘quantum haberet.'
But ‘ deberet ³ is evidently the true word,
as in c. 25, “ se decumanis plus quam de-
beret non daturum?

Sostratus et Numenius] Zumpt and
Klotz, in the usual fashion, place a comma
after ‘ civitatis,’ which leads a reader to ex-
pect another verb to which those names
are the nominative. This seems to be a
sufficient objection to this pointing, for
nouus thus placed before ‘ quum ’ are very
often the nominativos to the verb which
follows ‘quum.' It may be said that a
reader naturally, that is, according to the
organic laws of articulatiou, would pause
after the word ‘ civitatis: and that is true ;
but, as stops arc now used in the printed
texts of Greek and Latin authors, they ure
supposed to indicate iu some measure the
grammatical relations of words, und they
should therefore be struck out 1111011ον01-
they are likely to mislead in this matter.
But if this punctuation is objectionable, it
is still more so to place a colon after ‘ quan-
tum exura1·ant‚’ as Zumpt und Klotz do,
ln whatever way the (lcrnmns understand
the 001011, 11 is certain that 1111 English
reader will misunderstaud it. Iordau's
pointing is right.

consortes] This is explained by Klotz
to signify that 1110 three brothers had in-
herited a patrimonia] estate which they

had not divided3 they still held it as
tenants in common. He refers to Festus,
v, Sors, and v. Disertiones 3 and to Cuja-
cius, Observ. Lib. 5. 10. But see the note
ou ‘colonus aratorque vester! Horace
(Carni. iii. 24) has the expression ‘ consor-
tem socium.’ See also Cicero, Pro Flacco,
c. 15.

hominibus coactis] This is the expres-
sion used to signify a violent invasion of a
man’s property. The words are found in
the Interdictum de Vi ; Cicero, Pro Cae-
cina, 0. 21, vol. ii.: “Perge porro hoc
idem interdictum sequi: Hominibus Co-
actis.’'

familiam] This word seems to mean
the slaves only here. ln its widest sense it
comprehends all that is subjected to the
power of a person, a ‘paterfauiiliaS,' par-
ticularly when the discourse is of the pro-
perty of a testator considered as a whole;
as in the expressions ‘iiuuiliue erciscun-
dae,' * familiae emptor' (Gaius, iii. 102, Stin,
Cic. Dc Or. i. 56). Sometimes ’tinnilia’
is used to siguify all the persons who ure
subjceted to the power of a ‘ puterfannilias,’
all, both free and slaves ; und it may then
be opposed to ‘peeuuia‚’ or property, in
the sense of things only. Sometimes it
signities all the free persons who ure sub-
jected to the power of a ‘ puterlinnilias‚' a
uotion which is also extended to all the
’1101111113 or those whose desc-ent can be
traced to ono ⁸ paterfauuilias? Sometimes
it means the slaves only, as it probably
does in this pas-suge, und certainly does in
muny others. (l'ro Caecina, 0. 19, ““ uude
tu aut familia 11111 procurator 111115.υ Ad
Div. xiv. 4.) And sometimes it is used to
express things only as the collective 11111110
for a property: ‘ agnatus proximus fumi-
liam habcto' (Dig. 50. 16. 195).
