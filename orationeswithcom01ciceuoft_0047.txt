a ‘ quaestor ³ and his ‘ praetor‚' the usage of
our ancestors the sanetity of the lot.’' The
intimate relationship is first mentioned as a
well-known thing 3 then ancient usage, which
gave it strength3 and, finally, the sanctity
of the lot, for that which in form was
submitted to the decision of chance was in
effect, the will of the gods. (Phil. iii. c. 10,
vol. iv.) Comp. c. 20, “quicum mc sors

praestrinyat] Probany the true reading
may be ‘ perstringat’ (see c. 12; und 1³01·-

primary notion of ‘ stringere ' (stric) seems
to bc ‘ to hold fust or -tight, to press close
upon’ (Ovid, Met. iv. 135. 56()); and the.
componud, ‘ perstringi-rel is accordingly
used to signify the deadeningof the active
cucrgies of the body or the mind, us through
