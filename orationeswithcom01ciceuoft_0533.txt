two transverse bands. In the vertical band
there are two large ‘bullae,’ placed re-
spectively at the height of the two eross
bands ς andin each panel there is a smaller
‘bulla’ [n the upper part of each of the
central panels, which are larger than the
panels above and below, and right above
the ‘ bullae ' of these centra] panels, there
is the head of an animal, or whatever it
may be, which seems to correspond to a
door-handle, or the ‘Gorgonis os' which
Cicero describes.

qramineas hastas] Here the old com-
mentators were entirely at fault, partly
from an imperfect notion of the meaning of
‘ gramen‚' partly from want of that kind of
knowledge in which we have an advantage
over them. Hotmann would have ‘fraxi-
neas! The spear of Achilles was ‘ fraxinea?
As if there could be any thing surprising
in the size of ‘ fraxinea hasta) We might
make one of a whole tree, if wc chose. In
this instance, Lambinus, whom Zumpt
charges with being a servile follower of
Hotmann, does not follow him 3 but he
does not explain ‘ gramineas.' Graevius
makes an absurd attempt at explanation.
The reading is certain ; and Servius (Aen.
v. 287) refers to the passage: “Cicero de
Hastis: Bene etiamne gramineas hastas.-
quia gramhieum est ex gramine.'’ So the
passage stands in the edition of Vir-gil, by
'Maasviciuffi but the word ‘ Bene' is the
remark of ServiuS, aud should not be in
italics. Hotmann, who quotes Servius,
has it ‘Cicero de signis: ac„ which is
manifestly false; for Servius means to say
that Cicero applies Virgil’s word ‘gra-
mineum ' (Gramineum in campum) to ‘ has-
tae.’ But it does not appear that Servius
knew what the passage in Cicero meant.
Garatoni has explained the mystery. The
‘ gramineae hastae’ are bamhoos, a genus
of grasses‚ as botanists term them. Some
are thirty feet long, and even more; and
as thick as a man's body for some height

from the base. They are well known
now, and there is no difficulty in the pas-
sage. These ‘hastae' or canes must have
been brought from India, or parts further
East. I find no mention of African bam-
boos, teehuically so called; but it is pro-
bable enough that large canes may occur in
some parts of North Africa3 and there
are also large reeds in Sicily. These great
Indian canes were known to Ctesias (p. 248,
ed. Bahr): ὅτι ὁ Ἰνδὸς ποταμὸς ῥέων διὰ
πεδίων καὶ δι’ ὀρέων ῥεῖ· ἐν οῖς καὶ ὁ λεγό-
μενος Ἰνδικὸς κάλαμος φύεται. πάχος μὲν
ὅσον δύο ἄνδρε περιωργυιωμένοι μόλις περι-
λάβοιεν· rb δὲ ὕψος ὅσον μυριοφόρου νεώς
ἱστός. Ctesias has generally a foundation
of truth, and a superstructure of lies. He
adds, there are both larger and smaller,
wit-h the absurd remark, οἵους εἰκὸς νέ
ὄρει μεγάλῳ. Zumpt refers to Pliny (H.
N. xvi. 65, ed. Harduin.), who says among
other things: “arundini quidem Indicae
arborea amplitudo: qualem vulgo in tem-
plis videmus.’' He also cites L. Ampelius,
Liber Memorialis, c. 8 (Miracula Mundi),
who says of the Minerva of Athens: “ipsa
autem dea habet hastam de graminel’
These ‘hastae' were simply canes, for Ci-
cero says, ‘ neque manu factum quidquam)
They were merely wondrous things, which
a man may be satisiied with hearing Of} to
sce them more than once would be too
osten. Nobedy, except the stupid, go more
than once to look at things simply because
they are bigger than usual.

¹ Quod erant' Zumpt. The old editions
and Ra, Lg. 29, have ‘erat3' aud also
Klotz. ¹ Erat ' agrees better with ‘ id eon·
cupisti!
‘agitur autem de hastis gramineis!
common reading is ‘ etiamne id concupisti ;'
but Zumpt observes that the omission of
the ‘ne’ is usual in a continued interroga-
tion, where the particle has once been

used. He refers to Lib. 5. c. 47, and 58,
near the beginning.
