Urgebant comitia, et in his ipsis oppugnabar grandi pecunia. In-
stabat judicium3 ei quoque negotio fisci Sicilienses minabantur.
Agere quae acl judicium pertinebant libere comitiorum metu deter-
rebar: petitioni toto animo servire propter judicium non licebat.
Minari denique divisoribus ratio 11011 erat, propterea quod eos
intelligere videbam me hoc judicio districtum atque obligatum
futurum. Atque hoc ipso tempore Siculis denuntiatum esse audio
primum ab Hortensio, domum ad illum ut venirent: Siculos in eo
sane liberos fuisse, qui quamobrem arcesserentur quum intellige-
rent, non venisse. Interea comitia nostra, quorum iste se ut
ceterorum hoc anno comitiorum dominum esse arbitrabatur, haberi
coepta sunt. Cursare iste homo potens cum filio blando et gra-
tioso circum tribus; paternos amicos, 1100 est divisores, appellare

by several things as to 110 unable to turn
11110 way or the other. ‘ Obligatmn ’ must
be taken in its literal sense of ‘ bound,' or
the· nearly related sense of ‘ altogether 011-
gaged and occupied.' Shortly after 110
says, ‘animo . . vacuo et soluto.' Now as
‘solvere' is the correlative of ‘obligare‚’
‘ vacuus’ appears to be the correlative of

passage caused a difficulty to Asconius, who
proposes to read ‘venissent ς’ 111111, if we
observe that the next word begins with
‘ int,' it is possible that the ‘ nt ' of ‘ venis-
sent ' might accidentally have been omitted.
But the text is right, and 111-0110100111)

Cicero says; ‘ l hear, or Ι admit, that the
Sicilians were left to do as they liked 111

‘ Qui ' is the nominative to ⁸ intelligerentfl
‘Arcessere ' is compounded of the pre-
position ‘ar' (ad), which occurs in the
Bacchanaliau inscription, in the verb ‘ ar-
tuisse ' (adfuisse), and ‘cessere,' which is
formed from ‘ci-ere‚' as ‘facessere' from
‘ falc-ere,’ and ‘ lacessere ’ from ⁸ lac—ere!
convenire] ‘Quasi de promissorum de-
bito,' says Asconius5 111111 correctly. For
‘convenii-e,’ 111 one of its sensum, is ‘ in jus
vocare‚' ¹ agere cum aliquo,’ or to sue, as 1110
passages cited from the Digest 11)· Porcellini
show. But, when Asconius says that‘ ap-
pellare’ means ‘quusi liminares? this is
hardly consistent. lf ‘com'euire' is to
have this technical meaning, ‘appellare'
