530 IN O. VERREM

Decernunt statim, primum, Ut cum Lucio fratre hospitium publice
fieret, quod is eandem voluntatem erga Syracusanos suscepisset
quam ego semper habuissem. Id non modo tum scripserunt,
Verum etiam in aere incisum nobis tradiderunt. Valde hercule te
Syracusani tui quos crebro commemorare soles diligunt, qui cum
accusatore tuo satis justam causam conjungendae necessitudinis
putant, quod te accusaturus sit et quod inquisitum in te venerit.
Postea decernitur, ac non varie sed prope cunctis sententiis, Ut
laudatio quae 0. Verri decreta esset tolleretur. In eo, quum jam
non solum discessio facta esset sed etiam perscriptum atque in
tabulas relatum, praetor appellatur. At quis appellat? Magis-
tratus aliquis? Nemo. Senator? Ne id quidem. Syracusanorum
aliquis ⁴? Minime. Quis igitur praetorem appellat Ρ Qui quaestor
istius fuerat P. Caesetius. O rem ridiculam! 0 desertum hominem!
desperatum, relictum a magistratu Siculo! Ne senatus consul-

that the usual abbreviation S. C. has been
omitted by the copyists, is a reasonable
conjecture. If this is not so, we must
supply ‘id‚’ derived from the ‘eo.' The
‘in eo' seems to be well explained by the
words ‘ illud S. C. in quo' (0. 66).

in aere incisum] ⁶ Hospitii publici tes-
seram significat,' Hotmann. Graevius ex-
plains by several inscriptions what ‘ hospi-
tium facere ’ is. One inscription contains
the words ‘tesseram hospitalem cum eo
fecerunt.' Another is ‘Senatus Populusque

Timiligensis hospitium fecerunt cum C. Silio
C. F. Aviola, &c., eumque posterosque ejus
sibi posterisque suis patronum ceperunt.'
That these ‘ tabulae hospitales' were on
bronze, appears from the termination of
one of them in these tcrms: ‘ tabula hos-
pitali incisa hoc decreto in domo sua posita
permittat 0011500103 Graevius says that
there are other examples in Tomasinus,
cap. 2, de tesseris hospitalitatis,

cunetis] “ Vulgo legebatur conjunctis
sententiis ex deterrimis codicibus '³ (Zumpt).
See the note on ‘ cunctus,' Divin. c. 1.

In eo,] ‘ At vero ² is the common read-
ing. The 'mferior MSS. have ‘ an e0‚' which
is certainly wrong. R 3 λ Lg. 29 have
‘ in eo.' Lambinus edited from conjecture,
‘ Cum jam in id non solum,' &c., where ‘in
id' is rightly connected with ‘discessio 5'
but it is only a conjecture. ‘ In eo ' must
be connected with ‘ appellatur ε’ ‘hereupon
the praetor is appealed to? (See c. 66, ‘ in
quo praetor appellatus esset.')

But this reading (in eo) does not set all
right. For if the passage stands as it does
here, we must translate it ‘ therein (in eo), in
respect to that matter, though the division
had not only taken place, but (something)
had been drawn up and entered on the
records.' The ‘ something ' is the ‘ senatus
consultum i’ and Hotmann's conjecture,

discessio] The word applied to a division
in the Roman senate for the purpose of
ascertaining the votes (Gellius, xiv. 7).
Sallust says (Cat. 55) ‘senatus in Catonis
sententiam discessit? See Phil. 111. 0. 9,
and the note.

aliquis ?] ‘ aliqui ³ R 3, and Iordan.

P. Caesetius] The common reading in
the editions is ‘ Caecilius: which can be by
no means endured, says Zumpt, as Garatoni
has shown ς and one of his arguments set-
tles the matter—that Caecilius had long ago
left the province, had opposed Cicero in the
matter of the choice of a prosecutor, that
he had failed, and thereupon Cicero had
gone to Sicily to collect his evidence. All
which we know already 3 and it is not the
slightest presumption against this Caecilius
being in Sicily again, for he could go as
well as Cicero. The real argument is, that
the MSS. have a different reading, ‘ Caese-
cius,’ ‘ Cesetius,' and ‘ Ceselh'us.' P. Caese-
tius is mentioned in Lib. 5. c. 25. Hahn
thinks that the passage in Lib. 1. 0. 39,
refers to this Caesetius, ‘ Quaestorem se
in senatu expectare dicit.'

relietum] Zumpt rightly rejects Mad-
vig's proposed full stop after ‘relictum.’
Madvig would connect ‘ a magistratu Siculo '
with ‘ quis igitur praetorem appellat-³
