SICILY. 6:33

Symaethia] There was a river Symaethus, but no town of the name is mentioned
by any ancient writer, so far as Ι know.

Talarenses] Stephanus mentions Talaria as a Sieilian city, and the Ethnic name
Talarini.

Tim-inmas] As the name is Tissa or Tissae, Tissinenses is incorrect, and the true
Roman name is Tissenses, as in Cicero. Stephanus calls it xwpiv», which agrees with
Cicero’s ‘perparva et tenuis civitas' (Lib. 3. c. 38).

Triocalino] Tricalini in Stephanus, Cicero (Lib. 5. c. 4) has the same form as
Pliny.

Tiraeienses] Stephanus gives the name Τυρακῖναι, and Diodorus (xii. 29) Τιρακίη.
Harduin says that the MSS. of Pliny have the reading Triraceinses.

Zanclaei] Here Pliny mentions Zanclaei Messeniorum as Stipendiarii, and a person
might suppose that a different city is meant from that which he has already called
Messana, and ‘ oppidum civium Romanorum? So much carelessness and inaccuracy may
be perhaps charged 011 0111· present text, rather than on the conipiler. If the text is
right, it is difficult to say what Pliny means by the ‘Zanclaei Messeniorum in Siculo
Frcto,' for this is an appropriate description of the position of Messana, which he has
already mentioned.

Neither Cicero nor Pliny mentions all the places in Sicily; nor do
the texts of these two authors agree entirely. This is not the place for
a memoir on the ancient geography of Sicily, nor have I the materials
for it. The extract from Pliny, and the remarks 011 it, may not be alto-
gether useless for the illustration of the text of Cicero. Those who
seek information 011 the architectural remains of Sicily, and the medals
of the towns, some of them among the best specimens of Grecian art,
will have no difficulty in finding further illustration of some parts of
these orations in various works which have been specially devoted to the
ancient monuments of Sicily.
