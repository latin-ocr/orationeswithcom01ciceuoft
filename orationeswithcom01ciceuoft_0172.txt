154 IN O. VERREM

Romani loquar Ρ de istius impudentissimo furto seu potius novo ac
singulari latrocinio? ausum esse in aede Castoris, celeberrimo cla-
rissimoque monumento, quod templum in oculis quotidianoque
adspectu populi Romani positum est, quo saepenumero senatus
convocatur, quo maximarum rerum frequentissimae quotidie advo-
cationes fiunt, in eo loco in sermone hominum audaciae suae
monumentum aeternum relinquere? ἢ

L. Aedem Castoris, judices, P. Junius habuit tuendam de L.
Sulla Q. Metello consulibus. Is mortuus est. Reliquit pupillum
parvum filium. Quum L. Octavius C. Aurelius consules aedes
sacras locavissent neque potuissent omnia sarta tecta exigere,
neque ii praetores quibus erat negotium datum C. Sacerdos et M.
Caesius, factum est senatusconsultum, quibus de sartis tectis cog-
nitum et judicatum non esset, uti O. Verres P. Caelius praetores
cognoscerent et judicarent. Qua potestate iste permissa, ut ex C.
Fannio et ex Q. Tadio cognovistis, verumtamen quum esset omni-
bus in rebus apertissime impudentissimeque praedatus, 1100 voluit
clarissimum relinquere indicium latrociniorum suorum de quo non
audire aliquando sed videre quotidie possemus. Quaesivit quis
aedem Castoris sartam tectam deberet tradere. J unium ipsum

endam. L. Sulla, Q. Metello consulibus is

which last form V has in c. 47. But V
has ‘quaerimonia' It is only when o or
u follows ‘ qu ' that co or cu was written.

Castoris,] Tho temple of Castor and
Pollux (Act. ii. Lib. 5. c. 72), vowed by
the dictator A. Postumius in the Latin war,
after the battle near the lake Regillus (11.0.
499), and dedicated by his son (Liv. ii. 20,
42). It was destroyed in the time of the
Gallie invasion 3 but it must have been re-
built. L. Metellus Dalmaticus, consul B.O.
119, restored or beautified the temple. See
c. 59.

advocationes] ‘A place which is daily
crowded by those who attend there to give
their aid in matters of the greatest import-
ance.’ He means the ‘ advocati,' who
assisted parties with their advice and
aid, or sometimes even a ‘magistratus ;'
‘ii qui advocati sunt' (see Lib. 3. 0. 7).
They did not make the speech. That was
the business of the ‘patronus' 01· orator.
Forcellini, who quotes Asconius, takes the
word ‘ advocationes ² to mean ‘ consultatio,'
which is a mistake. It has the meaning
which it has in Cicero, Ad Fam. vii. 10.
‘ Advocatio: says Zumpt, ‘ coetus est eon-
gregatorum.’

mortuus est. Reliquit? dcc. It appears
(0. 55) that Junius made the contr-act
vm'th the censors L. Marcius, M. Perperna
(B.C. 86). We avoid the apparent contra-
diction by omitting ‘de‚' and connecting
the man’s death with the year of the
consuls. But, as Zumpt remarks, the
time of the man's death is quite im-
material. Ernesti supposes that the con-
tract, after being made with the censors,
was renewed with the consuls L. Sulla and
Q. Metellus (3.0. 80), at which time there
were no censors. It appears that the con-
suls L. Octavius, C. Aurelius (B.c. 75)
afterwards made the contracts for repairs
(aedes locavissent), but had not time to
examine if the contracts were performed as
to all the buildings (sarta tecta exigere).
Finajly, a Senatusconsultmn empowered
Verres and Caelius to examine into the
condition of the temples. ‘Tuendam'
means to maintain and keep in repair.

cognovistisg] “Ante rerum tamen la-
ciniam csse recte statuit Madv. 1. p. 327.''
(Iordan.) 1 ani not sure of that. Manu-
tius says, “ verum tamen dicam, quamquam
ex Fannio et Tadio cognovistis.”
