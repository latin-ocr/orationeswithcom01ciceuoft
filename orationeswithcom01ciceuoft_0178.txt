preceding members by the word ‘ et 3' for
that the word ‘ scilicet,’ this vehement in—
terrogation, should stand by itself. But
the graver objection, as he considers it, is
this, that Cicero does not affirm that which
110 ought particularly to affirm 3 he does not
say that, if the security was not sufficient,
further security would be given 3 and yet he
does not omit tomention the supposition of
insufficient security, buthe subjoins (in the
following· words) what would be an answer
for Verres, and show that he had acted
legally. This is Madvig's argument, as 1
understand it 3 for his language is not very
easy to understand. He adds, “nam si
non satis cautum putabat, qui poterat J u-
nium admittere? Ridicule ergo prorsus
interrogatur. Patet, illa: ⁶ et si non putas
cautum ' ita dici a Cicerone, ut vel hoc ex-
tremum effugium Verri occludatur 3 itaque
quemadmodum illa: ‘probatio futura est
tua' statim (c. 55) hoc modo repetuntur:
‘at erat probatio tua,' sic haec pars sic
effertur : ‘ at erat, et esset ampliuS, si velles,
populo cautum praedibus et praediis.' '³
He concludes that after ‘et si non putas
cautum' there should 110 something cor-
responding to ‘ at erat, et esset amplius'
&c. in the following chapter.

If there is no objection to the Latinity
of the passage, there is certainly none to
the argument. The youth is made to say
‘there was security sufficient 3 and if you
don't think that there was, you will,
forsooth, send just whom you please to
invade my property, and you will not let
me have the opportunity of protecting my
own interests! This is further explained
in the next chapter: ‘at erat probatio,'
&e. If the security was not sufficient,
Verres ought not to have taken advantage
of that, and given the contract to another,
the consequence of which would be the
ruin of the youth, who would be obliged to
pay a large sum for repairs, which he
could have made at a light cost. The
argument is ε ‘ if you don't think the
security sufficient, you will, forsooth, take
such a step as will ruin me at once, by
giving thc contract to others? The argu-

ment is perfectly clear, and the words are
sufficient. I cannot tell what MSS. have
‘cautum, scilicet.' Iordan only says ‘ pu-
tas cauta ³ ng. praeter 42 3 ‘putas caveto’
cod. Urs. Parr. Lall. So the error, if there
is any, lies in the words between ‘putas’
and ‘tu.' On this passage Halm says
“Brunnius writes ‘PVTAS c ΙΙ Η (probably
CAV) stands at the end of a line 3 the next
begins with AS, quite certain3 then four
or five letterS, perhaps LICET, but the 1
stands oblique: then Tv.''' Accordingly
Hahn conjectures that we should read
‘caveas licet. Tu praetor,’ ἂρ. So we
come to this, that the error if any lies in
‘ tum sci.³ Halm's suggestion is ingenious,
but the word ‘cautum’ ought to be
repeated. Ι think that the text as it
stands is as likely to be genuine as any
thing that can be devised.

55. lex operi] All the MSS. have ‘ ex,'
which the very learned Antonio Agustin,
archbishop of Tarragona, first recom-
mended to be altered to ‘lex‚' a certain
emendation 3 for this is the usual formula
‘Lex‚' &c. 3 and Cicero has just said
‘legem cognoscere,' ‘listen to the terms.'
The corruption ‘ex' easily explains the
corruption ‘opere,’ which all the MSS.
have except V, which has ‘ Lex operi?

Quid enim video aga] V omits ‘video
in.' The usual punctuation is ‘Quid
enim? video in multis,' ἂρ. Ι11 Horace,
1 Sat. i. 7, there is ‘Quid enim? concur-
ritur,’ according to the usual punctuation,
where Heindorf remarks that this form
of expression is common in Cicero, and he
compares it with τί wip.- in Greek. Ι (10

about τί ’γάρ ,· 111 Greek, for Greek construc-

tion does not explain Latin construction. η

Τ110 translation of the text of Cicero is:
‘ Don't I see in many old forms of letting
used by the censors 1³³ and that of Horace:
‘ Is not a battle fought ,Ψ It may also be

rendered correctly enough thus: ‘ Verres is -

correcting the ternis of the censors. Wen,
what of that? Ι 500 it is so in many of
the old terms of contract, &a Verres would
do something of the kind? It is plain that
