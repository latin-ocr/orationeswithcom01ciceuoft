quod Siculus a civi Romano, civis Romanus datur: ceterarum re-

Inter aratores et decumanos lege frumentaria, quam Hieronicam

13. P. Rupilii] P. Rupilius, consul
ΒΩ. 132, and proconsul of Sicily, Rc. 131,
with the advice of ten commissioners (de
decem legatorum sententia) settled the ad-
ministration of Sicily, and his regulations
and ordinances are often spoken of under
the term Lex Rupilia; not that his ordi-
nances were a ‘lex ' in the striet sense, for
a ‘lex' is that ‘quod populus Romanus
jubet,' hut they were so called as having
the substantial character of a ‘ lex,’
though not the formal. There are several
instances mentioned of the Romans regu-
lating a conquercd country hy sending
there a commission of Ten (Cic. Ad Att.
xiii. Epp. 4, 5, ὃς Livy, xxxvii. 55, “De-
cem legatos more majorum senatum mis-
surum ad res Asiae disceptandas compo-
nendasque”). Rupilius was consul with
P. Popilius Laenas, and conducted the
inquiry which followed the death of Ti.
Gracchus (Cic. De Am. c. 11).

Cicero cites mainly such parts of the
Lex Rupilia as related to the administra-
tion of justice, and wc may suppose that
Roman institutions were to some extent
thus introduced into Sicily. The follow-
ing chapters of this oration (c. 15. 17, 18),
in addition to this chapter, eontain some
of his rules. See. also llil». 3. e. lo. 12, 13,

and a ‘ civitas' might have a claim on one
of its own citizens or on a citizen of an-
other state. The ease of a claim by or
against a ‘ civitas ' against or by a citizen
of that ‘ civitas' seems to he excluded3
