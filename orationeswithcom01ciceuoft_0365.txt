onis suae esse '⁵ (Liv. 45. c. 29). The effect
was, that no inhabitant of ene ‘regio' could
contract a lawful marriage with 311111113-
bitant of another ‘regio ς’ if a union was
formed in the nature of marriage, it would
not have the effect of a legal marriage.
Further, no inhabitant of one region could
in any way acquire the ownership of land
or houses in another ‘regio,' a provision
which would be partly effected by the pro-
hibition as to inarriage3 at least, in case of
intestacy, there could be no claim by the
children of such a prohibited marriage, for
they would not be recognized as the off-
spring of a legal marriage. Such acquisi-
tion of land or houses also could not be
obtained under a testament, or by pur-
011350 ; if we interpret this proxision, as
we perhaps ought to do, according to the
strict meaning of the Roman term ‘ com-
mercium? Thus Macedonia was split up
into four parts, completely disunited. It
by no means follows that the inhabitants
of one ‘regio' could not live in another
‘ regio‚’ and carry on traffic ς and perhaps
they might hold land as occupiers or te-
nants, but not as owners.

‘ Commereium' is poorly explained in
Foreellini, where explanations are generally
very good and complete. As to the English
Lexicons, the reader may judge for himself
by looking at them.

There are some remarks on this passage
by Zumpt and Klotz which seem te 100
worth noticing3 not that the remarks arc
of any value, but they suggest the question
as to the right method of interpretation and
commenting. Zumpt observes that Cicero
takes pains (laborat) to show that Diocles
had no other reason for hiring the land,
except that he could not buy it ; but Zumpt
is of opinion that the hiring was simulated
on account of the legal impedinients, and
that there was a ‘ vera possessio agri maxi-
mi,' which 1 will not venture to translate.
Now Cicero does not take any particular
pains to prove that this man hired the land
because hc could not huy it. lf he was so
anxious to buy, why did he not go where
hc could buy ? The man wanted to sarm ;
and we. may suppose that he preferred the
land of Segesta to buying or hiring land
elsewhere. This is however of 110 great
importance. But the assumption that he
had bought in evasion of the law, contrary
to the law, and contrary to what Cicero

347

Pro decuma, quum pulsatus a Venereo
esset, decidit HS XVI millibus et medimnis DCLIIII.
NOMEN DIOCLIS PANHORMrrANI.

says, is a monstrous absurdity to bronch,
when we know nothing about the matter
except what Cicero tells us3 and he tells
us that he had not bought the land, and
could not buy it. If he bought it, we
must assume that he paid for it 3 that he
bought land, the title to which he could
never maintain‚ even against the man who
had sold it. Possibly, too, if the law was
what it ought to be, in order to secure its
object, the transfer might be valid against
the seller‚ bnt the land would be forfeited
to the ‘civitas' as soon as it came into
the ownership of a person who could not
hold it. But there is no end of the ob-
jections that may bc urged to Zumpt’s
assumption, which is snfficiently answered
by saying that it must be considered false
till he can prove it to be true. Klotz says
that he is of a different mind from Zumpt;
he thinks that Diocles was merely a tenant ;
and we may observe that there is great
weight in this remark, for this is precisely
Cicero’s statement, and we know no more
about the thing than what he tells 115.
However, Klotz has a little secret of his
own also. He says that Cicero merely
gave this explanation, that no one might
suppose that the words ‘ homo illustris et
nobilis' were not to be taken in their striet
sense, if Diocles was merely the tenant of
the land. But why should Cicero be so
anxious to save this gentleman's character
for respectability‚ when he was only doing
what other rich men did in Sicily 2> ‘⁴ ls
quum arationes magnas conductas haberet,
qnod homines etiam locupletes, sieut ille
est, in Sicilia facere consuerunt ’‘ (e. 231).
But why did Cicero make the remark then?
I can’t tell. lle might have omitted it,
and then all we should have known was,
that this man was a tenant-fiu·nier‚ like
many other rich Sicilians ; and neither
Zumpt, nor Klotz, nor 1, should have
made a note on this part of the passage.
However, Cicero has told us something
worth knowing, though it has no direct
bearing on the subject in hand ; and no-
thing is so common as for a man to do this
who has abundance ot· matter in him.

There is 110 rule to determine which is the
genuine order. lf the emphasis is placed
on ‘ ipsius,' it should come first.
