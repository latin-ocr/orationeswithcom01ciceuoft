402 IN O. VERREM

scriba donatus etad eam donationem contio est advocata. Quod
erat os tuum, quum videbas in contione eos homines, quorum ex
bonis istum annulo aureo donabas, qui ipsi annulos aureos
posuerant liberisque suis detraxerant, ut esset unde scriba tuus
hoc tuum munus ac beneficium tueretur? quae porro tua praefatio
donationis fuit? Illa scilicet vetus atque imperatoria, ‘ quandoque
tu quid in proelio, in bello, in re militari ³—cujus ne mentio quidem
te praetore ulla facta est: an illa, ‘quandoque tu nulla unquam
mihi in cupiditate sac turpitudine defuisti, omnibusque in iisdem
flagitiis mecum et in legatione et in praetura et hic in Sicilia
versatus ee, ob hasce res, quoniam te re locupletavi, hoc annulo
aureo dono.' Vera haec fuisset oratio. Neque enim iste annulus
aureus abs te datus istum virum fortem sed hominem locupletem
esse declarat. Ita eundem annulum ab alio datum testem virtutis
duceremus; abs te donatum comitem pecuniae judicamus.

videbas in contione] Zumpt omits ‘in
contione,' on the authority of Lg. 42,
‘ quoniam parum confert ad rem.' 1 think
most readers will have no objection to ‘in
contione,' and will think that it ‘multum

for the money was doubtless a competent
allowance. We must suppose that the
number of ‘modii,’ which the governor
would want, was estimated. for he had
four ‘sestertii’ allowed for a ‘ modius’ of

confert ad re1n,’ for it was not merely see-
ing, but seeing in the ‘ contio.'

quandoque tec] This was one of the old
Roman precise ‘forniulae,' which was re-
tained for solemn occasions. No people
stuck more closely to the rememhrance of
the past. Zumpt refers to Livy (ix. 10),
and the reading of Gronovius there in sup-
port of ‘ Quandoque tu,' instead of ‘ Quando
tu,’ the reading of Zumpt's MSS„ except
the four better, which have ‘Quandoque
tu.' Klotz refers to the Pro Caecina, c. 19,
‘ Quandoque te in jure conspicio? The
Variorum edition, the text of which is often
very bad, has ‘ Quanto tu quidem,' which
may be an error of the press ; for presently
after it reads ‘ Quandoquidem tu,’ &c.

ob hasce νεός] ‘ ob eas res ’ Zumpt,
from Lg. 42. The ‘ re ' after ‘ te ’ is only
found in Lg. 42; but Zumpt and Klotz
accept it, and it is hard to reject it.

81. aestimata] Cicero explains what he
has to say. The ‘praetor' had a sum of
money allowed him by the State for his
household, and the price was fixed at
which he must buy from the provincials.
If grain was cheap, he might be able to
save out of his allowance (c. 84) ; but, if it
was dear, he still had the grain at a fixed
price, and was sure of a sufficient supply,

wheat, and two for a ¹ modius ' of barley ;
but Cicero says, ‘numero ad summam tritici
adjecto ;' that is, Verres claimed the right
of taking a larger number of ‘ modii ' than
the number allowed him (c. 79). The price
of barley is here stated at half the price of
wheat, which, according to Dureau de la
Malle (Economie Politique des Romains, i.
104⁴), was the proportion at Athens also in
the time of Demosthenes. Verres indeed
took money from the ‘ aratores ' instead of
grain 3 and Cicero finds 110 fault with
Verres for doing this 3 for many good go-
vernorS, instead of taking from the ‘ ara-
tores' the grain which they might have
taken, and paying for it, allowed the ‘ ara-
tores' to compound for a sum of money,
which the ‘aratores' might be willing to
do in order to save themselves trouble ς
and so the governor would get something
under the head of ‘frumentum aestimatum‚’
in addition to the sum that he had for his
allowancc. If the price was higher than
the sum allowed by the State to the go-
vernor, the ‘ aratores ' might, without loss
to themselves, give him a sum of money,
instead of selling corn for less than the
market price, and the governor would no
doubt take care that he was not a loser by
the transaction. Verres, who put no
