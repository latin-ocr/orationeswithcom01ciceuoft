SICILY A ROMAN PROVINOE. 639

licly in Sicily, or, according to the more common Roman expression,
were sold, at a fixed period, and pursuant to the terms of the Lex
,Hieronica which terius were so caresully drawn up, that the cultivator
(arator) could not defraud the farmer of the ‘decumae' (decumanus),
nor could the ‘ decumanus ’ get more than his due (Lib. 3. c. S). These
‘ decumae ' were generally let to the Roman Publicani‚ but sometimes a
‘civitas’ would bid for the ‘decumae’ of its district. Cicero (Lib. 3.
c. 42) mentions an instance of the Thermitani bidding for their ‘ decu-
mae.' These ‘decumae ' consisted of a tenth of wheat and barley, the
only two kinds of grain which Cicero mentions3 and it seems that some-
times at least the tenths of wheat and barley were let separately (Lib. 3.
c. 34). The ‘decumae ' also comprised the ⁴ fruges minutae,' pulse and
the like, and oil and wine (Lib. 3. c. 7, and c. 71, note).

The price at which the ‘decumae' were sold was not estimated in
money, but by quantity (Lib. 3. c. 47, ὥσ) The probable amount of
the ‘decumae’ was estimated upon the ‘professio ' or declaration by
the cultivators of the quantity of land which they cultivated (Lib. 3.
c. 22. 47. 49). It seems that the inhabitants of a district were re-
quired to deliver their ‘ decumae ’ at the chief place of the. district, and
it was an irregular thing for Verres to require them to be delivered at
another place (Lib. 3. c. 43). The order of Verres, that the ‘ aratores ’
should carry their corn down to the coast, where it could be embarked
from Rome, only applied to the ‘ alterae decumae,’ or it was at least an
irregular order (Lib. 3. c.14‚ note on ‘ ad aquam ’). Dureau de la Malle
(ii. 427) concludes from this passage that the cultivators were obliged to
carry their ‘decumae ' to the coast; but this conclusion is not necessary,
and it is contradieted by another passage (Lib. 3. c. 43). He says in
another place (ii. 353), that “ the lands which enjoyed immnnity were com-
pelled to sell and to take every year to Rome, and at their own eost,
800‚000 modii of wheat, the price of which was four sestertii the
modius.'' But there is no authority sor asserting that they were required
to take the wheat to Rome, and the thing is altogether improbable.

There were small proprietors and cultivators in sicil-v, but there were
also many large cultivators‚ both owners and lessees of land, who em-
ployed a large capital on it (Lib. 3. c. 21). 'Phe ‘aratores' were both
Sicilians and Romans, who found profitablo employment for their capital
in the fertile island of Sicily: it was to the rich men of Rome what a
colony is to some British capitalists, or what Ireland may become to the
agricultural capitalists of England, when all the lands which are unpro—
fitable in the hands of insolvent owners have been transferred to thos-„t
who can make better use of them: “ quid illa, quae. forsitan ne sentiamus
quidem, judices, quanta sunt! quod multis locupletioribus civibus utimur,
quod habent propinquam, fidelem, fructuosamque provinciam, quo facile
