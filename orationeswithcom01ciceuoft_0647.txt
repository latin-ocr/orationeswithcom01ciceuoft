LIB. V. c. 54. 627

in matters relating to the property of the temple especially). Servilius
refuses to accept the ‘ sponsio,' because there was no proper legal com-
, pulsion3 because he, the great merchant of Panhormus, was required to
submit to the decision of ‘judiceS,’ not of his own ‘conventus‚' and also
partial ‘judices ;' because the loss of the suit, though it would bind him
only directly to the payment of a small sum of money, would still be
ruinous to him, for if he was ‘ convictus furti,’ he would thereby become
‘infamis’ and lose his chief civil rights. How-ever, Verres compelled
*Servilius to make the ‘sponsio' The rest of Mommsen's Excursus is
immaterial for the present purpose.

The whole story of this affair, as Cicero tells it, is contained in the
few words ‘Locutus erat . . . constitueretur? Servilius had spoken
freely about the knavery of Verres, who hears of what Servilius had said
and compels him to give the usual security (vadimonium promittere) to
a ‘ Venerius servus? Servilius promises the ‘ vadimonium‚’ and he goes
to Lilybaeum couformably to his ‘ vadimonium.’ Now Servilius could
not promise a ‘ vadimonium’ without having been already summoned ‘ in
jus,’ and being made acquainted with the action which the plaintiff in·
tended to bring (Lib. 3. c. 15, and the note on ‘ vadimonium ³) ; unless
Verres, whose conduct all *through this affair was illegal, compelled
Servilius to promise the ‘vadimonium ' in an irregular way, without
the previous legal forms. If Cicero’s stories about Verres are true,
he would have done any thing, and scarcely sought to cover his
iniquities with the forms of law. Cicero also says that Servilius pro-
mised a ‘ vadimonium’ to a slave, but we know that a slave could not be
a plaintiff or defendant in an action. Besides this, we know from
Cicero (Lib. 2. c. 8) that it was the office of the quaestor of
Lilybaeum to sue for any thing that was due to the temple of Eryx.
Verres on a former occasion refused to let the quaestor sue, and he
employed Naevius Turpio, one of his tools‚ to sue on behalf of the
temple. But Turpio was a Roman. Accordingly we are stopped by an
insuperable difficulty in the beginning of the story.

As soon as Servilius came to Lilybaeum, Verres urged him to make a
‘ sponsio ' with one of his lictors. &Vc do not know who tho lictor was,
but it is certain that hc was not a ‘Venerius servus,’ »because only
Roman citizens could use the formal words ⁶ Dari spondes& and ‘ spon-
deo ’ (Gaius, iii. 9:3); unless to make the same remark again, Verres
behaved as illegally in the matter of the ‘ sponsio’ as he had done in tho
matter of the ‘ vadimonium? If ho did, the lictor might be the ‘ Vene-
rius servus‚' to whom the ‘vadimonium ’ had bccn promised, or he might
be any other slave, or any body whom Verres pleased to name.

Though a slavo could not be a. plaintiff, Cicero says that Servilius
made a ‘vadimonium’ to a slave, and came to Lilybaeum pursuant
