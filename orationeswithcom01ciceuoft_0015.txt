given may be improved, for Ι do not consider that the text of
these orations is yet finally settled.

In the matter of orthography I have done nothing. The
orthography of Latin texts still remains to be settled3 and
there is a prospect that, in a few years, when the Latin lan-
guage has been more studied, and is better understood, our
printed texts will differ considerably in orthography from what
they now are. Though Ι have not followed Zumpt in the mode of
writing some words which he undoubtedly writes eorrectly, Ι have
still refrained from writing “ concio '² for “ contio,'' as the English

reprint of Zumpt does.

The notes are intended to explain the text. I have passed
over no passage where Ι found a difficulty myself, and very few
where others have found a difficulty. If Ι have often made
notes where some readers may not think them necessary, I
have done so because Ι know by experience that many students
will require such assistance. Ι have not intentionally coneealed
any obligations that I owe to other editors or commentators.
Indeed, in the matter of aeknowledgment, Ι have gone further
than is necessary3 for the modern commentators, whom Ι often
cite, have derived much of their materials from the earlier com-

mentators.

The Excursus may bc unsuitable for younger students3 and,
indeed, they were not desig-ned for them. If some of them arc
in parts obscure, I believe the fault is chiefly in the mattcr;
and Ι can't help that. Any person may see that the subjects
discussed in them arc necessary to the understanding of Cicero's
text; and those who arc competent to forman opinion will look
with indulgence on any errors that I have committed in treat-
ing such subjects for the first time in an edition of Cicero for
the use of Englishmcn.
