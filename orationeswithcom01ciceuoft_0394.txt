judices, alium HS cccc millibus, alium HS D, quem minimo, ccc.
Atque ei quum responsum essct fieri non posse, multos testes esse
dicturos, me praeterea causae non defuturum: Licet hercle, inquit,
omnes omnia dicant: in illo, nisi ita res manifesta erit allata ut
responderi nihil possit, vicimus.--Bene agis, Alba: ad tuam veniam
condit-ionem. Nihil putas valere in judiciis conjecturam, nihil sus-
picionem, nihil ante actae Vitae existimationem, nihil bonorum
virorum testimonia, nihil civitatum auctoritates ac literas: res ’

manifestas quaeris.

Non quaero judices Cassianos3 veterem judi-

tatem, religionem in judicando non imploro: Albam habebo judi-

Quintio, c. 6) has the same expression:
“tum Naevius pueros circum amicos di-
mittit: ipse suos necessarios ab atriis Li-
ciniis et a faucibus macelli cor1·ogat.”
Heindorf, in his notes on the line of Ho-
race, “Cum scurris fartor, cum Velabro
omne Macellum ’³ (2 Sat. 111. 229), quotes
Varro (De L. L. v. 147). Varro, after
speaking of the ‘ forum boarium, olitorium‚'
and others, adds, “ haec omnia posteaquam
eontracta in unum locum quae ad victum
pertinebant, et aedificatus locus, appella-
tum Macellum.'' Here all kinds of ‘ ob-
sonia? fish and flesh, were sold. (Comp.
Plaut. Aulul. ii. 8. 3, ‘ Venio ad Macellum :
rogito pisces. Indicant caros,' &c.) We
may suppose then that Aemilius was fond
of good living, and a constant visitor to the
Macellum, to 500 11011* prices were going,
aud what duinties were in the market.
Juvenal sayS, Sat. xi. 9:

“Multos porro vides quos saepe elusus ad
ipsum

Creditor introitum solet expectare ma-
ceni-’²

Heinrich (Juvenal, v. 94) has a good note
on Macellum. This great markct was sur-
rounded by a wall (maceria), and hence the
name ‘ macellum? Here all kinds of eat-
ables were sold—the raw material, as well
as things prepared by the RestaurateurS.
It was a place where 3 111311 might dine
(Ter. Eunuch. ii. 2. 25 ; Sueton. Caesar,
ο. 26). The word is accordingly used as a
general name for the provision market, as
in Suetonius (Tib. c. 34), “annonamque
macelli senatus arbitrio quotannis tempe-
randan1;” the prices of provisions in the
Macellum were to be regulated. There
were Macella in other places besides Rome.
Cicero applies the term ‘fauces’ to places

situated in some narrow space, as to Co-
rinth, on the isthmus (Forcellini, v. Fauces).
The word ‘ faucibus' seems to refer to the
position of this Macellum between highcr
grounds. Martial (11. 17, 0(1. Schneid.)
says:

“ Tonstrix Suburae faucibus sedet primis.”

The old Subura was in such a spot. Becker,
Handbuch, δια, 1. 521 5 and p. 543, on the
Macellum.

A bronze meda] of Nero contains on the
reverse the legend MAG Ave placed above
a building, the front of which has one
range of pillars resting on another range.
Agostini, Dialoghi, &c., p. 136, has some
remarks on the Mac. Aug. He observes
that MAc is sometimes read MAG, meaning
the Domus Aurea Neronis. But this 15 a
very improbable interpretation.

Licet den] Zumpt reads ‘Licet hercle,
inquit, omnes onmia dicant in illum : nisi'
&m Orelli has the same. Hotniann al-
tered ‘ in 1110 ’ into ‘in illum,' from an old
MS„ as he says. All Zumpt's MSS„ and
the old editions, have ‘ in illo 3' Lg. 42 has
only ‘illo.' I have kept the old reading,
which Klotz and Iordan have.

Bene (wi-53] ‘ Bene ais' Orelli 3 but the
best MSS. have ‘agis’ ‘Ais' is not so
likely to have been changed into ‘ agis‚' as
‘agis' into ‘ais.'—‘ ante actae ι’ Zumpt
omits ‘ante,’ 011 the authority of Lg. 42
0111 .
