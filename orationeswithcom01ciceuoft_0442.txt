VI.

Lib. 3. c. 47 t “ In jugero Leontini agri,” &a

CICERO informs us that the produce of wheat on the plains of Leontini
was ten for one in very favourable years; but that eight for one was a
good produce. The quantity sown on a ‘Jugerum' was a ‘medimnum '
as a general rule, ‘in'jugero Leontini agri medimnum fere tritici seritur
perpetua atque aequabili satione ς’ which does not mean that the land
was sown every year, but that the uninterrupted and regular practice
was to sow a ‘medimnum ’ on each ‘jugerum’

Dureau de la Malle (Economie Politique des Romaim, vol. ii. chap. 11)
has discussed the subject of the proportion between the seed and the
produce in Roman cultivation. The first passage that he quotes is from
Varro (De Re Rustica, i. c. 44), the substance of which is this: There
are sown on a ‘jugerum’ four ‘modii’ of beans, five of wheat, six of
barley, ten of far οι· spelter3 but sometimes more or less, according to
the locality and the soil: the same grain produces here ten for one, in
other places fifteen for one, as in Etruria and some parts of Italy: it is
even said, that in the territory of Sybaris in the South of Italy, in Syria
near Garada„ and in Byzacium in Africa, they get a hundred ‘modii’
for one; he adds, that it is important to distinguish in sowing between
new land, and land which is sown every year (which is called restibilis),
and land which rests sometimes.

This produce of a hundred for one is given by Varro merely as a
report; and it does not appear whether he believes it or not. Pliny,
indeed (H. N. xviii. 10, ed. Harduin), says that some land in the terri·
tory of Leontini produced a hundred for one3 but Cicero’s testimony is
clear and precise, that ten for one is an extraordinary produce for the
lands of Leontini. The produce is still the same in the plains os Catania,
which term comprises the former Leontini3 eight for one in good years;
” ten for one in years of extraordinary fertility. Probably the mode of
cultivation and the agricultural instruments have changed very little in
Sicily since the time of Cicero.

There is a passage in Strabo (vii. p. 311), in which he says that the
grain produce of the level and fertile part of the Taurica Chersonesus
(Orimea) was thirty for one.

Columella (iii. 3, 4) gives four for one as rather above the produce of
wheat lands in the larger part of Italy3 and this is stated to be the mean
produce at the present day in Piedmont. It appears then that fifteen
for one, or ten for one, which Varro speaks of, was an unusual produce
