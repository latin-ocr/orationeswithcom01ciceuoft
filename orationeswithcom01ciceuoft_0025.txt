INTRODUOTION. 7

a matter entirely distinct from the prosecution for his misgovernment of
Sicily-3 but the exposure of Verres in all the acts of his administration
q was consistent with his general design 111 publishing orations which were
never delivered. At the time when Cicero wrote these Orations the Lex
Aurelia, which made the judices eligible from the senate, the equites,
and the tribuni aerarii, was promulgated. It is also possible, as Drumann
observes, that the Lex was even enaeted, though Cicero in direct terms
speaks only of its promulgation (Act. ii. Lib. 2. c. 71; Lib. 3. c. 963
Lib. 5. c. 69), and threatens that Aurelius Cotta would carry his Lex
if Verres was aequitted. Now Verres, we know, was actually convicted
at the time when Cicero wrote these words3 and as Cicero represents
Verres as still on his trial, in order to give to his Orations the air of
being really delivered, so he would consistently represent the Aurelia

Lex as not enacted, but only promulgated.
Verres lived in banishment until the proscription of the Triumviri‚

Rc. 43. He carried with him some of the works of art which he had
collected during his official career, if the story is true that M. Antonius
put his name in the proscription-lists because he would not give up to
him his Corinthian vessels. (Plin. Hist. Nat. 34, c. 23 Seneca, Suasor. 6.)
It seems unlikely that this was the only cause of his being proscribed3
and yet it is not easy to suggest a good reason why such a man shared
the fate of many who were better than himself, or why Antonius was
his enemy. The same story adds that he died with contage, and not
before he heard of the death of Cicero, the most illustrious victim of
the vengeance of Antonius.

Drumann (Geschichte Roms, v. p. 263—328) has included in his
Life of M. Tullius Cicero an Abstract of the Verrine Orations, and a
History of the Prosecution of Verres. Halm also in his edition of
Cicero's ‘Reden gegen Q. Caecilius‚’ ὥσ, Leipzig, 1852, has written a
useful introduction to the Verrino Orations.
