’ 632 SIGILY.

Galatini] Supposcd by Harduin to bc the same as the Calactini of Cicero (Lib. 3.

c. 43), in which he may be right. Thc Ethnic name Calactini occurs also in Diodorus
xii. 29).

( Halesion] This is another of the words which was probably written both with the
aspirate and without. ι

Hennenses] I have before remarked on the forms Enna and Henna. Thc Greeks
seem to have sometimes prefixed the mark of aspiration, for an ancient coin of Henna
has the legend HENNAION.

Herbulensae] The same probably as the Arbelaei of Stephanus (v. Ἀρβέλη).

Ηαᾱναηὶέαηί] The coins are said to have ΑΔΡΑΝΙΤΑΝ without the aspirato, and so
it appears to be on the cast of a Sicilian coin which I have, but the legend is hardly
legible.

[albanenses] The name occurs in Stephanus (v. Ἴχανα), who gives the Ethnic name
'1 χανῖνος.

Ietenses] The name of the place occurs in Stephanus (v. ⁵lefrat'), who gives the
Ethnic name Ἰεταΐος. The Ethnic name is ΙΑΙΤΙΝ on a Greek coin. The remainder of
the word, which is not legible on the specimen that 1 have, is probably ΩΝ. The reading
Ietini appears then to be rightly restored in Cicero (Lib. 3. c. 43).

Mutustratini] This may be the Amestratus of Stephanus and of Cicero (Lib. 3. c.
39, and the note 3 also c. 43). A Greek coin has the first part of the legend AM quite
clear ; the rest not so legible. In a passage in the Excerpta of Diodorus (Lib. 23) the
name is written MustratuS, which is still nearer to Amestratus.

Mayellini] The name of the place is Μάκελλα 111 Polybius (i. 24) and elsewhere.

Murgentinj] The Greek orthography appears to be Morgantini. Harduin says ‘in
nummis MOPI'AN.’ A Greek coin has the legend MOPFANTINA very legible, and on
the face of the coin an ear of corn, probably to denote that it was a wheat-growing place-

flsutycenses] The people of Motyca or Mutyca, now Modica, as Harduin rightly says.
See Cicero, Lib. 3. c. 43, 51. All the MSS. of Pliny are said to have Mutycenscs. There
seems to be no doubt that Mutyca is meant by Cicero (Lib. 3. c. 43, 51), and not Motya.
There is a Greek coin of Motya, with the legend MOTTAION and the figure of a grey-
hound on it.

Menanini] ‘ In nummis apud Parutam ΜΕΝΑΝΙΝΩΝ and ΜΗΝΑΝῙΝΩΝ ’ (Har-
duin). If this is so, the place was called Menanum or Μέναινον, as in Diod. xi. 78. The
Ethnic name in Cicero (Lib. 3. c. 22, 43) is Menaeni, and so it is on a Greek coin legibly
MENAINQN.

Naxii] Naxos was destroyed by Dionysius B.C. 403. In B.c. 358 the scattered
inhabitants were collected by Andromachus, and settled on the neighbouring site of
Tauromenium (Diodorus, xiv. 15; xvi. 7). Pliny has already mentioned Tauromenium
as a colonia, and has incorrectly said that it was originally Naxos ; but it was a different
place. Here he speaks of tho Naxii as a politica] community at the time when he wrote,
and as ‘ stipendiarii‚' though they no longer existed.

Noaeni] Νόαι 15 mentioned by Stephanus, who makes the Etlmic name Νοαῒος.

Paropinz'] Pax-opus (Πάρωπος) 15 mentioned by Polybius (i. 24) as in the neighbour-
hood of Thermae ς and probably it was between Thermae and Panhormus

Platinthienses] Phintia is meant, or Phintias, as Diodorus calls it, near the mouth
of the southern Himera.. It was founded by Phintias, tyrant of Agrigentum (Diod. xxii.

Exc.). There is a Greek coin with the legend ΒΑΣΙΛΕὋΣ ΦΙΝΤΙΑ, and the figure of a
wild boar running. On the other face is a fine head.

semellitani] Probably a corrupt name. 1 can find nothing about it.
Scherim'] Schera is also mentioned by Ptolemaeus. The name Acherini in Cicero

(Lib. 3. c. 43), though the reading of au the MSS. except one, may be doubted. Pro-
bably it should be Scherini.
