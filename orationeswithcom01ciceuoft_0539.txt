AOT. II. LIBER QUARTUS. 521

rum ex omnibus aedibus sacris abstulit Syracusis. Itaque, judices,
ii qui hospites ad ea quae visenda sunt solent ducere et unum-
quidque ostendere, quos illi mystagogos vocant, conversam jam
habent demonstrationem suam. Nam ut ante demonstrabant quid
ubique esset, item nunc quid undique ablatum sit ostendunt.

LIX. Quid tum, mediocrine tandem dolore eos affectos esse
arbitramini Ρ Non ita est, judices z primum, quod omnes religione
moventur, et deos patrios quos a majoribus acceperunt colendos
sibi diligenter et retinendos esse arbitrantur: deinde hic ornatus,
haec opera atque artificia, signa, tabulae pictae, Graecos homines
nimio opere delectant. Itaque ex illorum querimoniis intelligere
possumus, haec illis acerbissima videri quae forsitan nobis levia et
contemnenda esse videantur. Mihi credite, judices, tametsi vos-
metipsos haec eadem audire certo seio, quum multas acceperint per
hosce annos socii atque exterae nationes calamitates et injurias,
nullas Graeci homines gravius ferunt ac tulerunt quam hujusmodi
spoliationes fanorum atque oppidorum.. Licet iste dicat emisse se,
sicuti solet dicere: credite hoc mihi, judices; nulla unquam civitas
tota Asia et Graecia signum ullum, tabulam pictam, ullum denique
ornamentum urbis sua voluntate cuiquam vendidit. Nisi forte
existimatis, posteaquam judicia severa Romae fieri desierunt,
Graecos homines haec venditare coepisse, quae tum non modo non
venditabant, quum judicia fiebant, verum etiam eo'e'mebant: aut
nisi arbitramini L. Crasso, Q. Scaevolae, O. Claudio, potentissimis
hominibus, quorum aedilitates ornatissimffl vidimus, commercium

quumjudieiaflebant,] That is, ‘ severa)
‘ Post judiciorum dissolutionem ’ means the
same as ‘ postquam . . . severa fleri desie-
runt.'

‘ Nisi forte existimatis ’ implies a nega-
tion, as Manutius remarks, It is a form of
expression which has the purport of 11 ne-
gation. The argument is this. During
the time that the ‘judicia ’ were striet nt
Rome, the Greeks were so fur from being
ready to sell their works of art, that they
were even purehasers of such things. It
is not likely that they would be ready to
sell when the ⁴ judicia ¹ eeased to be severe.
If they were so fond of these things as to
refuse to part with them, when, if they

sold them at all, they could command
their own priee, they would not 110 ready
to scll them when they might be forced by
a governor to part with them nt his price.
Or, he says, can you suppose that L. Cras-
sus, Q. Scaevola, and C. Claudius, who
exhibited such splendour 111 their ‘aedile-
ship,’ 111111 among other objects of display
there would be statues (Lib. 1. 0. 22), could
not trade with the Greeks for such things:
and that those who have been ‘aediles'
since could trade with them Ρ He does not
mean that these three 111011 111111 ‘ 00111-
mer(·ium‚' though Manutius takes it so.
Cicero means to say, you must not suppose
that they could not, and that others 0011111.
He means that nobody 0011111. Manutius
has mistaken the meaning of ’0011111101-
cium? The explanation of Lambinus is
nearer the. mark.
