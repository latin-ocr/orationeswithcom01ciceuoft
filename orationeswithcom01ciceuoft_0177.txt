has this ingenious remark : “ Illud fabrwm

a reading ‘ verum?

bonis, praedibus cta] This passage has
caused some difficulty. Klotz has a long
note on it, but I think that he has mis-
taken the sense of the passage in following
Hotmann. The first question is, if ‘ bonis’
is an adjective, as Asconius takes it to be,
when 110 says “ bona praedia dicuntur bona
satisdationibus obnoxia ;'’ and “praedia
sunt res ipsae ς praedes homines, id est,
fidejussores, quorum res bona praedia [non]
uno nomine dieuntur.’'

But Klotz is right in taking ‘ bona ’ to be
a substantive, though he takes it iu the
wrong sense. ‘ Praedes ' are ‘fidejussoresss
persons who are securities. ‘ Praedium ' is
land 3 ‘praedium urbanum ³ is land in a
city, with buildings on it; ‘praedium rus-
ticum ' is land in the country, with a house
on it, a ‘villa' (hig. 50. 16. s. 27, 115,
221). The expression ‘ bona vendere,
praedia vendere,’ is common. ‘ I‘raedes
vendere’ occurs in Cicero again (l‘hil. ii.
31) ; and the expression must mean, to sell
all the property of a ‘ praes? Cicero then
means to say, that when a sale of this kind
is made by consuls, quaestors‚ or others, to
satisfy the demands of the state, the person
whose property was thus put up had a pre-
ference, if he oll'ered and paid the whole
amount ; and why should the same not be
the ease in letting a conti-act Ρ For, if the
temple required repairs, why not let the
‘ tutores ' of the ‘ pupillus· ' have the con-
tract, t'or the repairs must be done. at his
cost; and the state had the security of his
‘praedes ' and (their) ‘ praedia P’ ‘ lt· you,
the praetor, do not think that the Cautio
is sufficient, will you put whom you pleuse

in possession of my property, and will you
not allow me to have the opportunity of
protecting my own interests, that is, of
having the conti-act for repairs, which
repairs must be done at my eost, and you
will have the opportunity of judging if
they are properly done θ’

Manutius saw the right meaning of the
passage, except that hc understands ‘ prae-
des' to be ‘mancipias or slaves, an error
which Graevius correets. ‘Bonis' means
any ‘bona' of any person which are sold
by the state.

quisquam accedit ?] There is hardly
any sense in the common reading ‘quid
acceditP’ Klotz and Iordan have ‘quis-
quam aecedit ?’ according to V.

tua qui loeas .·] The. relative is some-
times used this way, and refers to its ante-
cedent implicated in the adjective pro-
00110. There 15 a similar expression in a
letter of Cato to Cicero (Ad Fam. xv. 5),
“ ut tuam virtutem . . domi togati, armati
forisl’ ‘Probatio’ means that the ‘lo-
cator' will have the power of deter-
mining if the contrat-t was properly per-
110-10011. ‘ Probare ' was the usual word in
such a case. 'l'he small theatrc of Pom-
peii has the inscription
