AOT. ΙΙ. LIBER PRIMUS. 95

iste atque istius amici, homines lauti et urbani, sermones hujusce-
modi dissipassent quo animos testium retardarent, me magna pe-
* cunia a vera accusatione esse deductum, tametsi probabatur nemini,
quod et ex Sicilia testes erant ii qui quaestorem me in provincia
cognoverant, et hinc homines maxime illustres qui, ut ipsi noti
sunt, sic nostrum unumquemque optime norunt; tamen usque eo
“timui ne quis de mea fide atque integritate dubitaret, donec ad
rejiciendos judices venimus.

VII. Sciebam in rejiciendis judicibus nonnullos memoria· nostra
pactionis suspicionem non vitasse, quum in ipsa accusatione eorum
industria ac diligentia probaretur. Ita rejeci judices ut hoc con-
stet, post hunc statum rei publicae quo nunc utimur simili splendore
et dignitate consilium nullum fuisse. Quam iste laudem communem
ait sibi esse mecum, qui quum P. Galbam judicem rejecisset, M.
Lucretium retinuit; et, quum ejus patronus ex eo quaereret, cur
suos famssiarissimos, Sex. Peducaeum, Q. Considium, Q. Junium
rejici passus esset, respondit quod eos in judicando nimium sui juris
sententiaeque cognosceret. Itaque judicibus rejectis sperabam jain
onus meum vobiscum esse commune3 putabam non solum notis
sed etiam ignotis probatam meam fidem esse et diligentiam. Quod

Verres iste, non possunt illi, qui ei op-
ponuntur, et ipsi isti vocari.'’ But why
not Ρ

lauti et urbana] It might be supposed
that these words were spoken ironically ;
but that supposition is not necessary.
‘ Lautus‚' a form of ‘ lavatus? ‘ well washed ¹
or ‘ clean‚' had numerous derived significa-
tions, the history of which it is not easy
to truce, and even in modern languach,
in like cases, it is often a matter of difli—
culty. The sense here is perhaps ‘sharp’
or ‘clever,' as in the passage of Caecilius
quoted by Cicero, De Am. c. 26, ‘ emunx-
eris lautissime? In Act. ii. Lib. 1. 0. 25,
there is ‘parum laute,’ which the context
explains. ‘ Urbanus ’ 15 explained by Klotz
in this passage to siguify 000 who pos-sesses
the cunning and sharpucss which are sup-
posed to character-ize towus’ people as op-
posed to country folks3 and 110 refers to
Quintilian, lust. Or. vi. 3, § 105, for a
(lcfinition of ‘in-hunus: as theu under-
stood. Zumpt refers to a passage in Cicero’s
letters (Ad Fam. iii. 8) : “ te hominem non
solum sapientem, verum etiam, ut nunc
loquimur, urbauum.'’ Sec Heindorf, Horat.

changeS, ten years before. The ‘rejectio ’
of the ‘judices' was the test of Cicero’s in-
tegrity in the prosecution, for he made it
apparent that he wished to have an honest
‘ consilium? ll'hen Cicero says that Verres
claimed credit too, he 1001105, of course, to
deny his claim ; for l’. Gallia. whom he
rejected, was an honest man, and Lucretius,
whom he kept, was not. Asconius tells 115,
whether it is a guess, or whether he had
authority for it, that Lucretius 11115 aster-
wards rejected hy Cicero, for the 111-0115011
had the first challenge. The reason which
Asconius gives for affirming that Lucretius
was rejected by Cicero is sufficient, for
Cicero could not speak disparagiugly of any
‘judex ‘ who 11115 retained : and, indeed, he
culogizes the whole ‘ consilium? The reason
which Verres 15 alleged to have given for
allowing the rejectiou of the other three,
which meam, us Asconius sayS. rejecting
them humeln—that they were men too 111-
dependeut (sui juris), 15 another sarcastic
refutation of the claim of Verres.
