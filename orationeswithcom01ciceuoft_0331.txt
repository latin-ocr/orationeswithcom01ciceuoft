moveat reliquus metus judicii sit. Si judicio vis a me exigere,
remove Siculum magistratum : si hano vim adhibes, quid opus est
judicio? Quis porro erit quin malit decumanis tuis dare quod
poposcerint quam ab asseclis tuis quadruplo condemnari P

XIV. Illa Vero praeclara est clausula edicti, quod omnium con-
troversiarum quae essent inter aratorem et decumanum, si uter
velit, edicit se recuperatores daturum. Primum, quae potest esse
controversia, quum is qui petere debet aufert, et quum is non
quantum debetur sed quantum commodum est aufert; ille autem
unde ablatum est judicio suum recuperare nullo modo potest3
deinde in hoc homo luteus etiam callidus ac veterator esse vult,
quod ita scribit, Si uter volet, recuperatores dabo. Quam lepide
se furari putat! Utrique facit potestatem3 sed utrum ita scrip-
serit, Si uter volet, an, Si decumanus volet, nihil interest : arator
enim tuos istos recuperatores nunquam volet.

Quid illa cujusmodi sunt quae ex tempore ab Apronio admonitus
edixit? Q. Septitio honestissimo equite Romano resistente Apronio,
et affirmante se plus decuma non daturum, exoritur peculiare edic-

towns com-ts for the recovery of the‘ decu· quadruplum? with the ‘recuperatores’ of

mae, ’if they were not paid. The ‘deeu-
manus' would declare his demand, and the
Sicilian ‘magistratus' would enforce it.
“What other process remains against the
‘ arator ?’ '³ says Cicer05 “ this is enough,-
there is no need of any other.’' “ It is 110
bad thing‚” Verres is supposed to say,

“ that there should be an apprehension of ’

that 011161·1>1·06688,111 which the ‘’arator
may be sued for foui-sold the value of the
demand, in order that, thou< rh the‘ arator’

The object of the supposed ‘mator' is to
show that the ‘judicium in octupluin'

against the ‘decumanis 11111611 looks xery
861616, aas a sarco. For, in the first in-
stance, the‘ arator’ could be compelled by
a Siciliam ‘magistratus’ to pay whatever
was demanded. If he complained‚ he had
before his eyes the fear of a ‘judicium in

V erres for ‘judices3' and if he came before
them as a plaintiff, to 1660161· 1116 ‘-oetu

fail.

14. quod . . . edicit] Those who call
‘quod’ a conjunction will find nodiffieulty
here. But it is the relative, and 1116101·-
mula is ‘ Illa . . edicti, quod . . edicit!

quae essent] Here we have the sub-
junctive in 0116 of its general, indeterminate
senses. ‘ In all disputes which might arise ’
is not an adequate version. Our expression

‘in all disputes arising between ' is neurer
the sense of the Latin.

Ιιοιηο luteus] The old reading, and that
of Ernesti, is ‘ 13·nceus,’ which has 110 861186.

‘Luteus' 11166118, says Zumpt, a worthless
fellow. A dirt3v 1”(·11011·,1161·11ιι118. See Lib.
2. c. 78, ‘tamquam iu 1uto;’ ‘luto voluta—
tum ' (Lib. 4. 6. 24). ‘ Luteum negotium ’
(Lib. 4. c. 14), in a somewhat ditl'ercnt
sense, perhaps.

Si uter] ‘ Uter ' is here said to bc equi-
ialent to ‘alteruter ' (Zumpt).

Quid illa (16] Zumpt and lordan, as
usual, ‘ Quid Ρ illa cujusmodi,' &c., whereas
the repetition of the question is in the

‘eujusmodi.' The reader 111111· put a eonnna
after ‘ illa,’ if he prefers it, or he may learn
to read the passage right without this
