Gelensibus ‚] The people of Gela (Γέλα),

one of the old Greek settlements' m Sicily,
founded by Rhodians from Lindus, and
Cretans. It was on the south coast of

antea dioei ,] about Rc. 207, and the Romans gave it a
kind of new constitution (Lib. 2. c. 50;
Lib. 4. c. 43). The ruins of the colossal
temple of Olympian Zeus, the temple of
Concord, as it is now commonly called,

Sicily y, between Agrigentum and Camarina. which is nearly complete except part of

The name Gela is from the name of the
river near the city ; and we observe that

Ἴ several Sicilian towns have the name of

the river on which they were situated.

, This once flourishing place, the parent city

of Agrigentum, was a ruin before the age
of Cicero. Dionysius destroyed the old
aristocratical constitution by massacring
the chief inhabitants (13.C. 406), and the
place was afterwards plundered by the
Carthaginians (Diod. xiii. 108). lt was
again plundercd by Agathocles (13.c. 311) 3
and finally, it is said, that the remnant of
the inhabitants were transferred by Phin-
tias, tyrant of Agrigentum, to his new
town 01“ Phintias (Diodorus, Ι ib. 22. 0. 2).
But the town 01“ Gela could not have been
entirely destroy cd, nor all the inhabitants
removed, if Ciceio' s story is true about the
restoration of the statues. Besides 11115,110

Awqtdyentinis ·] This city, called by the
Greeks Aen agas, 01100 the largest city iu
Sicily, requires a historv. brom its Roman
name Agrigentum, 15 tormed the modern
conuption (111-«501111. It never recovered
110111 the damage which it sustained from
the Ca1·tlmgi11iaus(n.c. 405: Diod. xiii. 90).
lt finally came under the dominiou 01“ Rome

the entablature and the roof, and other
remains, make this the most interesting
historical town in Sicily. The greater part
of the old city appears to have been 111 the
valley. The medem stands on the height
once occupied by the ancient citadel.

The period of Phalaris is not quite cer-
tain. 1f his reign commcnced 13.C. 570, as
Eusebius in one passage states, 110 was a.
contemporary of Croesus, king of Lydia.
This story 01“ a brazen bull, made by Peril-
lus, on whom the tyrant made the 111-51,
experiment with it, by roasting him iu thc,
inside, is told by sevi ral writers of antiquity
(Diodorus, xiii. 903 Polybius, xii. 25, ed.
Bekkcr). Here Cicero mentions a bull 115
recovered from the Carthagiuians. ‘There

bull of Phalaris, or another that was called
the bull of Phalaris, may bc doubted.
