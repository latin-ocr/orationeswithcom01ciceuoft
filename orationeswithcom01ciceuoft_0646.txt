On Lib. 5. c. 54.

ΠΑΙΔΙ has an Excursus on the words ‘vadimonium promittere—sponsio-
nem facere.’ The Excursus was communicated to him by Professor
Theodor Mommsen.

After explaining what the Vadimonium was, and that in ordinary
cases ‘is qui vadatur’ and ‘is qui agit ’ (the plaintiff) are the same
person, Mommsen says that in this passage the case was manifestly dif-
ferent. If the ‘ sponsio’ was merely the regular commencement of the
‘acti0‚’ notice of which was given at the time of the ‘vadimonium,'
Cicero could not possibly have said ‘quum ageret nemo ;’ and the
identity of the ‘ Venerius servus ’ and of the lictor with whom C. Servi-
lius was required to make a ‘ sponsio‚’ is more than doubtful. Accord-
ingly it appears that Verres set up a pretended claim of the temple of
Venus at Eryx, which was within the conventus of Lilybaeum, and com-
manded Servilius to make a, ‘vadimonium' to appear at that place.
Servilius appeared, but the suit of which notice had been given had no
foundation and could not be prosecuted3 and, as was always the case,
when the defendant appeared and the plaintiff did not appear, the
plaintiff lost his cause. In this case the plaintiff did not appear; but
Verres devised a new plaint‚ at least a new plaint in form, for it is most
probable that an alleged illegal act with respect to the property of the
temple was the foundation bot-h of the first ‘vadimonium ' and of the
‘ sponsio‚’ which the lictor proposed to Servilius. The ‘ Venerius servus’
had evidently served the purpose of furnishing some reason for bringing
Servilius from the ‘conventus Panhormitanus? before the courtof another
‘ conventus.’ For as the temple of Venus Erycina made a demand, it
would appear equitable to summon Servilius to the ‘ eonventus' in which
Eryx was included, to Lilybaeum.

Mommsen then explains what a ‘ sponsio ' was 3 and continues thus.
The ‘vadimonium’ is given up3 O. Servilius, against whom there is
neither a civil action nor a crimina] charge, is entirely free. Then
a lictor of Verres comes forward and challenges Servilius to the suit,
undertaking to prove to him that he, Servilius, was enriching himself by
means os ⁶ furtum,’ that is, by knavery and fraudulent means (probably
