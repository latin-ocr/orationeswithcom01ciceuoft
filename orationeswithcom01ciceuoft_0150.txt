132 IN O. VERREM

servos artifices pupilli quum haberet domi, circum pedes autem
homines formosos et literatos, suos esse dicebat, se emisse. Quum
saepius mater et azia pueri postularent, uti, si non redderet pecu-
niam nec rationem claret, diceret saltem quantum pecuniae Malleoli
deportasset, a multis efflagitatus aliquando dixit HS decies:
deinde in codicis extrema cera nomen infimum in flagitiosa litma
fecit: expensa Chrysogono servo HS sexcenta millia accepta
pupillo Malleolo rettulit. Quomodo ex decies HS sexcenta Sint,
facta; quomodo Dc eodem modo quadrarint ut illa de Cn. Carbonis
pecunia reliqua HS sexcenta facta sint3 quomodo Chrysogono
expensa lata sint; cur id nomen infimum in lituraque sit vos
existimabitis. Tamen HS sexcenta millia quum accepta rettulisset,
HS quinquaginta millia soluta non sunt3 homines, posteaquam
reus factus est, alii redditi, alii etiam nunc retinentur: peculia.
omnium vicariique retinentur.

an improbable conjecture (Act. ii. Lib. 2.
c. 10), if ‘literam' is unintelligible. If

‘ litera ’ is right, it has reference to ‘ ratio,'
‘accounts‚' and means, that he did not
give in a single letter of accounts.—‘ mul-
tis efflagitatus? Orelli. But ‘a multis‚'
which Zumpt has taken from some of the
best MSS„ seems better; for (1111111153 35
Zumpt observes, is ( multis verbis?

circum pedes] 1 suppose that this
means ‘about him,' ‘in attendance 011
him?

codicis affra] ‘ Codex' or ‘codices,' or
‘ codex accepti et expensi,' ‘ tabulae,' ‘ do-
mestica ratio,' are names for account-books,
which were, it appears, sometimes kept on
tablets smeared with wax. At the bottom
of the ‘codex,’ in the lowest part of the

‘Umbella' there was an erasure in the last

entry (nomen). As to these ‘codices,'
which every citizen kept who was ‘sui
jnris,' see Pro Rosc. Am. c. 2, 3.

expensa affe] These are the. 1151131Βο-
man forms. ‘ Expensum ferre‚' or ‘re-

51(101113111311’5 books: ( acceptum ferre,j or
‘referre‚' is to make an entry of money re-
ceived, or on the debit side. If a man
lent another a 511111 of money, it would
appear in the lender's books as an ‘expen-
sum' (Phil. vi. c. 5). Verres entered six
hundred thousand as received by him on
account of Malleolus, but he also entered
the same amount as paid to Chrysogonus.
“ You may conjecture,” says Cicero, “ 11011
110 reduced thc ‘decies ³ (centena millia) to
‘sexcenta millia? '’ Comp. c. 39, ‘Quod

appear how Verres could discharge him·
self by such an entry against Chryso-
gonus, who was probably his slave. His
books showed that he had received the six
hundred thousand, and he was answerable
for it. But we cannot explain that which
Cicero professes himself unable to under-
stand. See c. 38, note on ‘his nominibus. '

quinquaqinta millia ᾦα] The common
reading 15 ‘quinque 11111113311111011 Ernesti
explains thus: that Verres did not pay even

shows. Verres was bound to pay what his
books showed that he had received3 but,

trived to retain ‘quinquaginta millia,' as
the best MSS. have it.

peculia ᾦα] Τ110 ( peculium ' was that
property which a ‘ filiusfamilias,' that is, a
son who was in his father’s power, or a
slave held, with the father's or master's
consent3 for a ‘ filiusfamilias,’ or a slave,
could not strictly hold propert-y. Allthat
a son acquired, with some limitations
(castrense peculium), and all that a slave
acquired, belonged to the father or master 3
but, by usage, a slave had a kind of pro-
perty which was considered his own, and
it was called his ‘ peculium. ²
