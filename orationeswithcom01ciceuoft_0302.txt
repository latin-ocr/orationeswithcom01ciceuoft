(lid the ‘decumani' come to interfere in
the matter? The ‘magister’ of the ’50-

of the way and called a meeting of the

were great rascalsg but in modern times
worse things are done. The Roman system
of farming the taxes was bad, but we can-
not say whether in those days it would
have been better for the Roman state to
employ tax collectors 3 I mean better both

legem . . promulgatam] The Lex of L.
Aurelius Cotta, the praetor, which was
enacted under the name of the Lex Aurelia,
was promulgated in this year, B.C. 70. The
expression ‘legem promulgare,' that is,
‘pi-evulgare, ’ is not quite correct, for ‘ pro-
mulgare’ signified to put up notice of a
pr01)ose(l‘lex,' or ‘rogatio,' as a ‘lex' was
called before it was enacted. The correct
expression ‘rogationem piomulgare' is used
by Sallust. Festus correctly considers‘ pro-
mulgare ' the same as ‘ provulgare.’
Cotta was not a patrician, but 110 was
‘nobilis,' for 1115 0110051015 long before him
