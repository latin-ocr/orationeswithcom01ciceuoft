EDICTA MAGISTRATUUM. 181

‘interdicta retinendae possessionis ;’ and, again, out of these grew the
⁷ ‘ interdicta recuperandae possessionis.' The determination of the fact of
possession determined who should sustain the part of plaintiff, and who
should sustain the part of defendant3 and in the mean time security was
taken, as already observed, that the person out of possession should not
be a loser, if his right was ultimately acknowledged. This is a simple and
natural explanation of the origin of the Roman right of possession⁴.
Cicero argues quite consistently with this, when he finds fault with
Verres (Act, ii. Lib. 1. 45) ι “ ergo quia possessor est, non moves posses-
sione: si possessor non esset, non dares.” For a man was not to be
maintained in the possession simply because he was in possession, for he
might have got the possession against his adversary by illegal means3
nor ought the Praetor to refuse him the possession, simply because he
had it not, for he might be entitled to have it.

The Lex Aebutia, which is of uncertain date, introduced a new mode
of procedure, according to which the claims of a party were drawn up
by the Praetor in a written formula, the terms of which were indepen-
dent of the words of any Lex. The Praetor being thus freed from the
ancient forms was enabled to grant actions, which could not be founded
on the Jus Civile or the strict law (Graius, iv. 11), and in this way a
class of Actiones called Honorariae, from the honor or office of the
Praetor, was introduced. To allow a right of action in cases where no
such right has existed, is the same thing as to acknowledge a new right3
for a right of action implies the existence of a previous right, or the
existence ofa wrong or legal injury. It is not to be supposed that a
Praetor arbitrarily allowed new rights of action. He was merely the
organ to declare what already existed in the common understanding of
thc people‚-the consciousness of a want and the necessity of a remedy.

The Praetor in many cases, while he framed his formula with reference
to some old-established rule of law, gave it a wider application. lle
could direct the Judex to decide in a given case as if certain facts
existed which did not exist,——a mode of proceeding which might lead to
great abuse in unskilful hands, but might be made useful and just when
the purpose of the Magistratus was honest and the law was defective.
For the Roman Law must not be viewed as modern systems os law may
be, which are the results of the experience of past ages. The Romans
had to create what they wanted, and all that we have here to consider
is the way in which they satisfied their wants. Circumstances might
and did occur, for instance, in which a man was not owner os a thing

⁴ This is Puchta’s view of the matter. Savigny, following Niebuhr, looks for the
origin of the Right of Possession in the notion of possession in the case of the Ager
Publicus. I think that he is inistakcn. (Dus Recht des BesitzeS, p. 172, δια, 5t11
