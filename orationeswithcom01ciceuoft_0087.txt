ACTIO PRIMA. 69

praetorum potestate? Quid faceres pro innocente homine et pro-
pinquo, quum propter hominem perditissimum atque alienissimum
de officio ac dignitate decedis, et committis ut quod ille dictitat
alicui qui te ignorat verum esse videatur Ρ Nam hoc Verrem dicere
aiebant, te non fato ut ceteros ex vestra familia sed opera sua
consulem factum. Duo igitur consules et quaesitor erunt ex illius
voluntate. N on solum effugiemus, inquit, hominem in quaerendo
nimium diligentem, nimium servientem populi existimationi, M'
Glabrionem: accedit nobis etiam illud; judex est M. Caesonius,
collega nostri accusatoris, homo in rebus judicandis spectatus et
cognitus ⁷; quem minime expediat esse in eo consilio quod conemur
aliqua ratione corrumpere, propterea quod jam antea, quum judex
in Juniano consilio fuisset, turpissimum illud facinus non solum
graviter tulit, sed etiam in medium protulit. Hunc judicem ex
Kal. J anuar. non habebimus. Q. Manlium et Q. Cornificium, duos
severissimos atque integerrimos judices, quod tribuni plebis tum
erunt, judices non habebimus. P. Sulpicius, judex tristis et
integer magistratum ineat necesse est Nonis Decembr. M. Cre-

10. qui te ignorat] This is the reading what follows that the ‘ aediles: as well as

of Orelli. Zumpt, Klotz, and Iordan have
‘ ignoret? It is one of those cases in
which, as far as we can judge, usage was
somewhat unsettled. 1 think that ‘ alicui
qui te ignorat ' is intended to be a positive
affirmation.

te nonfato] According to Asconius, the
old poet Naevius said of the Metelli,

“ Fato Metelli Romae fiunt consules ;''

to which Metellus, the then consul, replied‚
“ Dabunt malum Metelli Naevio poetae.’'

It is said that Q. Metellus, consul B.c. 206,
a contemporary of Cu. Naevius, was one
of those who were the cause of Naevius
being banished from ltaly. lt is, however,
argued, that this verse, ⁴ Fato,' ac„ could
hardly be by Naevius, the author of the
poeni on the Punic lVar, as it was in his
lifetimc that two of the Metelli were the
first of their family who attaiued the
highest honours of the state. It is eon-
eluded, then, that the verse, ‘Fato Me-
telli,' &c.‚ was a saying current among· the
people, and that Cicero alludes to it.

M. Caesonius,] Caesonius was now one
of the ‘judices ;’ but, as he was elected
‘ aedilis ' with Cicero for the following year,
he could not, during his office, act as ‘ju-
dOX,’ if the trial should be deferred to the
next year, which was the great object
of Verres, as Cicero sayS. It appears from

the ‘ eonsuls' and ‘ praetors,’ at this time
entered on their office on the lst of J anu-ary.
C. Junius was the ‘quaesitor' under a
‘Lex Cornelia: on the occasion of A.
Cluentius prosecuting his step-filther Op-
pianicus, who was convicted of an attempt
to poison, as it was believed, through
some of the ‘judices' being bribed by
Cluentius. Caesonius, however, one of the
‘judices ' in that trial, was innocent, aud,
according to Cicero, helped to expose the
villainy (Rein, Das Crimiualrecht der
Rbmer, p. 429, 654).

Q. illanlium et Q. Cornificium] It is
not said here when the ‘tribuni plebis’
entered ou their office, nor ean we assume
that it was the Neues of December. for
Asconius‘, who observes that P. Sulpicius
would enter ou his office of ‘tribunus
plebis ' 011 that day, has drawn a false con-
clusion, or barely asserted what is not true.
If P. Sulpicius had been a tribune,:he
would have been mentioued with l.. Mau-
lius and Q. Cornificius Klotz is inclined
to the opinion of the scholiast of Gronovius,
that P. Sulpicius ma)⁷ have been a ‘ quae-
stor? It- appears that the tribunes
entered on their office before the consuls
(De laeg. Agr. ii. 5). Cicero was ou terius
of intimacy with the son of this Cornificius,
to whom he nddressed several letters (Ad
Fam. xii. 17, 18, 19).
