habeo rationem quid a populo Romano acceperim: mihi ludos
sanctissimos maxima cum cura et caerimonia Cereri, Libero Libe-
raeque faciendos, mihi Floram matrem populo plebique Romanae

ludorum celebritate placandam,

mihi ludos antiquissimos, qui

primi Romani appellati sunt, cum dignitate maxima et religione
J ovi, J unoni, Minervaeque esse faciundos, mihi sacrarum aedium
procurationem, mihi totam urbem tuendam esse commissam: ob
earum rerum laborem et sollicitudinem fructus illos datos, anti-
quiorem in senatu sententiae dicendae locum, togam praetextam,

sellam curulem, jus imaginis ad

Tacit. Ann. ii. 49, ‘Libero Liberaeque et
Cereri? These three deities had a eom-
mon temple near the Circus Maximus.
The superintendence ef the temples is here
mentioned as within the province of the
‘aediles' (sacrarum aedium procuratio),
which is explained to mean, that they had
to see that the temples and other public
buildings were maintained in good con-
dition, and were not used improperly
by private persons, or injured. See the
Tab. Heracl. 1. v. 68, QVAE LOCA PVB-
LICA, διο. They had also the general super-
intendence of police, and of matters
which concerned the public health (totam
urbem . . . commissam). Their duties
were indeed multifarious.

Among other privileges Cicero mentions
‘ antiquiorem . . . locum.' He would have
a prior rank (antiquior) or precedence in
giving his opinion in the senate, next to
those ef highcr rank than himself, ‘ censu-
lares ’ and ‘praet01·ii.’ The ‘sella curulis’
was the official seat or chair of the ‘aedilis
curulis,' and of the ‘magistratus' who
were above the ‘aediles curules) The seat,
‘ sella‚’ a diminutive from the ferm ‘ sedi,’
as if it were ‘sedula,’ was ornamented
with ivery, whence the expression ‘ curule
ebur? lt is most usually spoken of with
reference to the ‘praet‹›r‚' aud is often
simply called ‘sella,' as 111 these orations.
The etymology which Gellius gives (iii.
18, after Gabius Bassus) from ‘currus’ is

incerrect, nor can the derivatiou srem
‘curia' be accepted. In Sueten. Augus-

tus, c. 22, there is however the expres-
sion ‘ Curulis triumphus?

Plutarch (Marius, e. 5) derives ‘curulis'
from the curved form of the chair, er
rather the legs, so that it would contain
the crude form ‘cnrve:’ δύο ’γάρ εἶσι
τάξεις ἀγορανομῶν, ἡ μὲν ἀπὸ τῶν δίφρων
τῶν ἆγκυλοπόδων ἐφ’ ὧν καθεζόμενοι χρη-
ματίζουσιν ἔχουσα τοῦνομα τῆς ἀρχῆς.

memoriam posteritatemque pro-

This correspeuds with the form of the legs
in what are supposed to be representatione
of the ‘ sella curulis,' as they are given in
Smith's Dict. of Antiqus.

vius (Observv. 1. 12): prodendam codd.
Cic. et Nonii'' (Iordan). The expression
in the oration Pro Rabirio Post. c. 7 is
‘ imago ipsa ad posteritatis memoriam
prodita.' The form in which this passage
is given, Lib. 3. c. 4, note, is a quotation
from Becker, which ef course 1 did net
alter. *Zumpt has herc altered the text
to ‘ prodendae,’ as he does not think that
‘prodendam ’ is capable of explanation.
Orelli also and Iordan have ‘pi-edendae?
If ‘ posteritatemque' were omitted, there
would be no difficulty. We have ‘ ut . . .
memoriam proderet,’ Caesar, B. G. i. 13 ;

a memorial of the person. ‘ posteritas ’ is
the state or condition ot' ⁸ poste1·i,' aud is
generall)¹ used by Latin writers precisely
as our word ‘ posterity' is. But there is
perhaps no reason against its being taken
111 the sense of a ⁴ futurity ’ generally, “ ι111
after existence,’ or something of the kind.
There is a passage in Cicero 111 which it
seems to have a sense very near this, Tuse.

to mean ‘ filinae apud posteros) Klotz

‘futui-itys aud he considers ‘ad memo-
