Marcelli statua pro patibulo in clientes Marcellorum suit? tu ex
⁷ illius honore in eos ipsos qui honorem habuerant supplicia quaere-
bas ? Quid postea, quid tandem tuis statuis fore arbitrabare? An
vero quod accidit? Nam Tyndaritani statuam istius quam sibi
propter Marcellos altiore etiam basi poni jusserat, deturbarunt
simulac successum isti audierunt.

XLII. Dedit igitur tibi 1111110 fortuna Siculorum O. Marcellum
judicem, ut cujus ad statuam Siculi te praet-ore alligabantur, ejus
religione, te isti devinctum adstrictumque dedamus. ‘Ac primO,
judices, 1100 signum Mercurii dicebat iste Tyndaritanos M. Mar-
cello huic Aesernino vendidisse, atque hoc sua causa etiam M.
Marcelfilm ipsum sperabat esse dicturum ; quod mihi nunquam
verisimile visum est, adolescentem illo 1000 natum, patronum Siciliae,
nomen suum isti ad translationem criminis commodaturum. Ve-
rumtamen ita mihi res tota provisa atque praecauta est ut, si
maxime esset inventus qui in se suscipere istius culpam crimenque
cuperet, tamen is proficere nihil posset. Eos enim deduxi testes et
eas literas deportavi ut de istius facto dubium esse nemini posset.
Publicae literae sunt deportatum Mercurium esse Messanam sumptu
publico. Dicent quanti. Praefuisse 111110 negotio publice legatum

qui honorem habuerant] The pronoun

M. Claudius Marcellus, the father of Aeser-
‘ illi ' is generally added after ‘honorem ς’

but Zumpt has omitted it on the authority
of C3 λ. R has it. It was probably
added by some one who wished to explain
thc meaning. Cicero ask-s, ‘did you seek

cannot with certainty discover what the

Aesernino] He is mentioned in tho
Brutus, c. 35, where Meyer remarks that

with the Teutones, as a ‘legatus ' of Ma-
rius, B.C. 102. In the Mars-ie war, after
the defeat of the consul L. Julius Caesar,
13.c. 90, hc tled to the colony Aesernia,
and was eoinpclled by famine to surrendcr
to the Samnites (Liv. Ep. 73). His 500
was called Aeserninus from this igno-
niinious circumstance.

pos-seh] ‘possit' Ing. 29, Halm.

Publicae lilerac’ suu! ⁴513] ‘There is
evidence in the public records that the
Mei-cury was taken.’ Cicero sometimes
uses this sorni, which is a short way ot'
saying, ‘Ex publicis literis constat: or
something of the kind.

Quid is, ubi ex! l] Cicero first says,
‘Quis est hic P’ ‘ Who is he ?’ ‘ Theman
who was fastened to the statuo) Then,
‘Well‚ the man who was fastencd to the,
statue, where is he Ρ Yon have 5000 him,
