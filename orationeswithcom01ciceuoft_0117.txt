AOT. Π. LIBER PRIMUS. 99

molestissimum, bis ut causa dicatur, quod aut mea causa potius est
constitutum quam tua, aut nihilo tua potius quam mea. Nam si
’ bis dicere est commodum, certe utriusque commune est3 si eum
qui posterius dixit opus est redargui, accusatoris 031153 ut bis age-
retur constitutum est. Verum, ut opinor, Glaucia primus 1111110111
comperendinaretur reus; antea vel judicaii primo poterat vel 3111-
plius pionuntiari. Utram igitur putas legem meliorem? opinor
illam veterem, qua vel cito absolvi vel tarde condemnari licebat.
Ego tibi illam Aciliam legem restituo, qua lege multi sefioel accusati,
semel dicta causa, semel auditis testibus, condemnati sunt, nequa-
quam tam manifestis neque tantis criminibus quantis tu convinceris.
Puta te non hac tam atroci sed illa lege mitissima causam dicere.

Accusabo; respondebis: testibus

again, so that the two speeches for the de-
fenee came between the two speeches for
the prosecution. But this is absurd. Cicero
argues that the ‘ comperendinatio ³ was
rather intended for the advantage of the
prosecutor, for he would have the oppor-
tunity of replying to 1115 adversary's de-
101100. ‘ Si 011111 qui posterius dixit ' is evi-
dently the speaker for the defence, for the
speech for the prosecution was delivered
first, and, if there was no ‘compereinlinatio‚'
the matter was ready for the decision of
the ‘consiliu1n,’ when the prosecutor had
spoken first and the speaker for the defencc
had replied. If, argues Cicero, the object
or purpose (opus) is for the second speaker
to be replied to, then it is clear that the
‘secunda actio’ (ut bis ageretur) was in-

tended for the benefit of the prosecutor.

It could not be intended for the benetit of
the accused ; for, if the prosecutor brought
forward no new matter in his second speech,
the defendant would gain 1055 by a second
reply, than the prosecutor would by en-
forcing his original arguments and 0051101·-
ing the answer of his adversm-y. And, if
he did bring finrward new matter, it must
be something that he had neglected to bring
foi-ward before, or something that he had
in the mean time discovered; in neither of
which cases would the second ‘ actio ' be for
the benetit ot the accused.

Glaucia] C. Servilius Glaucia who pro-
posed (tulit) the ‘ lex ’ that bears his name.
(Ex. i. ii.) Zumpt agrees with Ernesti in
making the Acilia prior to the Servilia Lex.
XVhen Cicero says ‘ ut opinor,' he does not
mean to express a doubt. 1Ιο speaks as a

Hs

man who does not concern himself very par-
ticularly about the history of changes in
law: he takes it for granted that it is 50.
Before the Lex Servilia the ‘judices ' either
gave their votes at once, or declared an
‘ampliati0‚' an adjournnient to another
day, which might be a more distant day
than the ‘dies perendinus.’ The ‘amplia-
tio ’ depended on the choico of the ‘judiees’
The ‘comperendinatio’ was fixed by 11115
‘ lex.' The old law, says Cicero, permittcd
the ‘ judices ' either to aequit at once, orto
defer their decision for some time. He
professes to restore in ell'ect the Lex Acilia,
which was enacted on the proposal ot Aci-
lius Glabrio, the father of the ‘praetor'
who picsided at this trii113and this ‘lex’

allowed no compcundm 1110 or ‘amplia-

tio! But h« ,51115 10 Hortensius: 1011ιὲ100

very lenient law. suppose this to 110 the
ca<e; Cicero will then make his charge,
Hortensius will answer; and, after the
witness-cs arc produced, Cicero will bring
the ‘judiees' to their votc; for that 15·
‘mittere in consilium :’ and he says that
even if the ‘lex ’ were to allow an ¹ am-
pliatio,' they would be ashamed to nvail
themselves of it. Verres was prosecuted
under the Lex Cornelia, which we must
suppose to have contained the provisions uf
the Servilia, except as to the class from
which the ‘judices’ were to be ehosen.

Orelli, Klotz, aud Iordan have ‘legem
molliorem.' ‘Meliorem' Lg. 29; ‘me-

liorem ' G 1 2, Zumpt. Iordan does not say
what the other MSS. have.
