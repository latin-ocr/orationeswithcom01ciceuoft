EDICTA MAGISTRATUUM. 187

who had no legislative power, had however a power, by virtue of his
office, of engaging in the confiict between new opinions and new wants,
and old rules of law and old habim, and of establishing by way of expe-
riment, during his year of office, such new rules as he and his advisers
considered to be suited to the time. The Praetor's rules were thus
tried and tested during his year of office without being put in the rigid
form of a. statute (lex) : whatever was found to be good, was accepted by
his successor3 and thus in course of time the rules of the Edictum
obtained the sanction of usage, and were respected just as much as if
they were a statute (lex). Being promulgated in writing, they belong
to the division of Written Law (J us scriptum).

Papinianus describes the character of the Jus Praetorium in these
words (Dig. i. 1. 7. ξ 1): “ Jus praetorium est quod praetores introdux-
erunt adjuvandi vel supplendi vel corrigendi juris gratia propter utili-
tatem publicam.’' Instances of the several cases here mentioned
are easily found3 but one of the most striking is the case in which the
Praetor gave the Bonorum Possessio of an ‘hereditas' to those who were
not entitled by the J us Civile. After laying down the rules of the
Twelve Tables as to the ‘intestatorum hereditates‚’ or the succession
to the property of intestates‚ Gaius adds (iv. 25): “sed hae juris iniqui-
tates edicto Praetoris emendatae sunt‚” and he proceeds to state in
what cases the Praetor gave the Bonorum Possessio to those who were not
‘ heredes ipso jure‚' but who by the Edict of the Praetor ‘loco heredum
constituuntur) Thus the claims of persons to the property of intestates
were extended to persons who had 110 claim according to the narrow
rules of the old law 3 and this extension was not effected by a Lex, by
the people in their legislative capacity; but it was effeeted by the
popular will through its organ the Praetor, and not in the way of direct
legislation, but by gradual steps and in an experimental way.

It has been shown in what manner through the orgau of the Praetor
the Jus Praetorium was established. The peculiarity of the Jus Prae-
torium does not however consist 111 its form only: it is characterized by
other matter also. This character has been shown to a certain extent,
but its character will bc secu more clearly by a short statement of the
nature of the Jus Gentium, as conceivcd by the Romans.

Every nation has something peculiar by which it is distinguished from
other nations3 and it has something in common with all. This is also
the case with its law, which, from originally having a strongly marked
individual character, assumes 0110 which is more general and more com-
prehensive. This change is in a great degree effectcd by the inter-
course amongst difl'crent peoplc. The pcculiar form which this moro

general and comprehensive law assumed among the Romans, is the Jus
Gentium.
