ACTIONIS SECUNDAE

DE PRAETURA URBANA.

INTRODUOTION.

ΤΗΕ five books of the Actio Secunda were written after Verres’ trial
was ended, as already stated (p. 6) ; and Cicero wrote them in such a
form that they might be read as if they had been delivered at the trial of
Verres. If he observed in writing them the same rules which he would
have observed in delivering them, or, to express the same thing for

Nor does Cicero confine himself to general statements and to general
abuse of Verres for his acts as quaestor and legatus: he even produces
evidence against Verres, that is, he affects to produce evidence; and, as
I have said, if he wrote as he would have spoken if the trial had
continued, he would have produced evidence against Verres about his
misconduct as quaestor and legatus In c. 14 he refers to written
evidence about the accounts of Verres in his office of quaestor. In
c. 21 he refers to the accounts os P. Servilius in order to contrast them
with the accounts of Verres. In c. 31 be produces documentary
evidence about the scandalous conduct of Verres in the affair of
Lampsacus, and in c. 34 in the matter of Verres' behaviour to the
