aratoribus populi Romani, ab iis qui vobis laborant, vobis serviunt,
qui ita plebem Romanam ab sese ali volunt ut sibi ac liberis suis
tantum supersit quo ipsi ali possint, ab his per summam injuriam,
per acerbissimas contumelias, plus aliquanto ablatum esse quam
natum sit? Sentio, judices, moderandum mihi esse jam orationi

Motya (Μοτύη), a considerable place near
Lilybaeum, on a small island connected
with the main land by a dyke (Diod. xiv.
48), now Isola di Mezze, an old Phoeni-
cian settlement (Thucyd. vi. 2). But there
are several reasons for supposing that this
is not the place. Himilco removed the in-
habitants of Motya (B.C. 396) to the site
of Lilybaeum, and from that time we hear
no more of it. Resides, such a place could
hardly have a territory. lt was amere
eommereial post and stronghold ; and in
fact Motya was lost in Lilybaeum (now
Mars-ala). There can then he no doubt
that Mutyca is Modica. “The 0001011 01“
Modica is a eounty of about eighty thou-
sand inhabitants, aud possessing nearly a
hundred and twenty thousand acres of
land.”——'1¹here is “a superior spirit of 110-
tivity and 11010511)γ among the natives, at-
tended by greater affluencc aud comfort
than any other agricultural part 01· Sicily

fertile as the rest '' (Smyth's Sicily, p.
191).

esc Ilyblenxium paelsonibux] The place
is Hybla Major, so called to distinguish it
from two other places of 1110 same 101010 in
Sicily. Hybla Major was on the southern
slope of Aetna, on the Symaethus3 now
Paterno on the Giaretta, according to
some authorities.

qui ita . . volunt] This is a most extra-

vagant way of showing the fidelity and at-
tachment of the Sieilians to Rome. There
is great difficulty in translating it, which
Ι remark for the benefit of those who
may not discover the difficulty. ‘ V olunt’
expresses ‘will,' ‘purposess and the like,
not ‘ wish? ‘ Ita' is related to ‘ ut,’ but
this relation is very difficult to express in
English. The meaning is: ‘the Sieilians
have a hearty good—will to maintain the
Roman plebes, and they ask for no better
temus than to have enough left for the sup-
port of themselves aud their children.’ lt
is ludicrous to us for an orator 10 represent
these lahorious cultivators ossa-ily as work-
ing with hearty good-will to support the
lazy population 01“ Rome, and eontcnt if
they could only have enough left to give
them strength to go on working. Cicero
is here alluding to the provisioning os
Rome, which had long been 11 settled part
of Roman policy. The state provided the
grain, and sold it sor less than the eost,
at least to the poor. The produce os the
‘ decumae ’ eost nothing. except probably
the transport from the coust to Rome;
and ns the state got this corn eheap, they
could sell it cheap. Corn was also bought,
as we learn from this oration, when thero
was scal-city. The distribution os corn
gratis did not hegin until aster the dato
of this oration, as it is said ; and the tri-
bune Clodius has 1110 eredit of introducing
this pestilent measure (11.0. 58). See tho
note c. 70.
