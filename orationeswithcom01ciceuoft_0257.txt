ACT. Π. LIBER SECUNDUS. 239

rabit in curiam P Verum veniat sane: decernat bellum Creten-
sibus3 liberet Byzantios3 regem appellet Ptolemaeum3 quae vult
Hortensius omnia dieat et sentiat: minus haec ad nOS, minus ad
vitae nostrae discrimen, minus ad fortunarum nostrarum periculum
pertinent.

Illud, [illud] est capitale, illud formidolosum, illud optimo
cuique metuendum, quod iste si ex 1100 judicio aliqua vi se
eripuerit, in judicibus sit necesse est, sententiam de capite civis
Romani ferat, sit in ejus exercitu signifer qui imperium judiciorum
tenere vult. Hoc populus Romanus recusat, hoc ferre non potest:
clamat permittitque vobis ut, si istis hominibus delectemini, si ex
isto genere splendorem ordini atque ornamentum curiae constituere
velitis, habeatis sane istum vobiscum senatorem, etiam de vobis
judicem si vultis habeatis: de se homines, si qui extra istum
ordinem sunt, quibus ne rejiciundi quidem amplius quam trium
judicum praeclarae leges Corneliae faciunt potestatem, hunc homi-
nem tam crudelem, tam sceleratum, tam nefarium nolunt judicare.

XXXII. Etenim si illud est tam flagitiosum quod mihi omnium
rerum turpissimum maximeque nefarium videtur ob rem judicandam
pecuniam accipere, pretio habere addictam fidem et religionem;

Various important matters, which Cicero
alludes to, were under discussion at
this time. L. Metellus, the colleague of
Hortensius (B.c. 69), had dccl-ared war
against the Cretans, and Byzantium was
made a ‘libera civitas! Ptolemaeus is
probably Auletes or Ptolemaeus XII„ who
suceeeded Alexander or Ptolemaeus xl.
At this time Alexander was king, but he
was ejected a few years afterwards, and
died at Tyre. Auletes reigned in his
stcad.-—-‘decernat,' ‘liberet,’ ‘appellet‚'
mean of course ‘let him vote for‚’ &cu

adspirabit in curiam ?] Cicero is fond
of this poetic expression. See Divin. c. 16 ;
and Lib. 1. 0. 54, ‘ ad meam pecuniam . .
adspirat ς’ Pro P. Sulla, e. 18. virgil has
it (Aen. xii. 352) with a dative.

quibus ne rejiciundi quidem] It appears
that the Lex Cornelia. did not allow those
who were not senators to ehallenge more
than three ‘judices’ in a criminal trial3
but Verres, as a senator, had the right of
challenging more, and had challenged six
at least, as Zumpt shows by reference to
Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 73 Lib. 3. c. -1-1; and
Lib. 5. c. 44. The conjecture of Antonio
Agustin, that the ‘ trium judicum rejectio ’
was enacted only by the Cornelia Lex do

Repetundis, will, as Zumpt observeS, ex-
plain ‘si qui extra istum ordinem sunt,’
for few except senators were likely, as ex-
perience showed, to act in such manner
as to come within the penalties of the Lex
de Repetundis.

trium judicum] Zumpt refers to his
Grannnar (ξ 661) for four other examples
from Cicero of a genitive in the place of an
accusative when coupled with a gei-und.
In Cicero, De Invent. ii. 2, there is ‘⁴' ex
majore enim copia nohis qnam illi fuit
exemplorum eligendi potestas? A refer-
ence to the host of erities who have dis·
cussed this subject is given in the iisteenth
Exi-ursus in Crenzer and Mosei-’s edition of
this oration. Compare “Ab his fit ini-
tium retinendi Silii atquc Velanii‚” Caesar,
Β. G. iii. 8, and Schneider's note. In this
passage Lg. 29. 42 have ‘ trium iudicium,²
as Halm observes.

32. lanista-qitiosum] Most ofthe MSS.
have ‘ ta·=n‚’ it appears, except Lg. -1-:3 N;
and why it should be rejected nobody has
yet explained. Orelli thought it should be
‘jann' In the letter of Cicero, Ad Q. Fr.
i. 1. 5, Ernesti thinks that ‘tani fideles'
should be ‘jam fideles? lf a man will
carefully read these orations, he will
easily dispense with this suggestion.
