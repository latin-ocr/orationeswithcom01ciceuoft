578 IN G. VERREM

filiam, quam iste propter amorem ab Rhodio tibicine abduxerat3
Pipa quaedam, uxor Aeschrionis Syracusani, de qua muliere plu-
rimi versus qui 111 istius cupiditatem facti sunt tota Sicilia perce-
lebrantur. Erat Nice, facie eximia, ut praedicatur, uxor Cleomenis
[Syracusani] Hanc Cleomenes vir amabat, verumtamen hujus libi-
dini adversari nec poterat nec audebat; et simul ab isto donis
beneficiisque multis devinciebatur. Illo autem tempore iste, tametsi
ea est hominis impudentia quam nostis, ipse tamen quum vir esset
Syracusis, uxoremejus parum poterat animo soluto ac libero tot in
acta dies secum habere. Itaque excogitat rem singularem: naves
quibus legatus praefuerat Cleomeni tradit; classi populi Romani
Cleomenem Syracusanum praeesse jubet atque imperare. Hoc eo
facit ut ille non solum abesset a domo tum quum navigaret, sed
etiam libenter cum magno honore beneficioque abesset, ipse autem
remoto atque ablegato viro non liberius quam antea—quis enim
unquam istius libidini obstitit P—sed paulo solutiore tamen animo
secum illam haberet, si non tamquam virum, at tamquam aemulum
removisset. Accipit naves sociorum atque amicorum Cleomenes
Syracusanus.

Pipa? the conjecture of Schiitz.

Erat Νίσᾳ] Zumpt's former reading
was ‘Erat et Nice ;' but he struck out ‘et'
in his larger edition, and it is in no MS.
There is probably some error here. The
preceding sentence begins: ‘ There were,
besides, certain married women, women of
rank, except one, the daughter of the 1111-
mus Isidorus, whom Verres had taken away
from the Rhodian flute-player 3' and then
we come to the enumeration of these noble
1adies, of whom Pipa is first ς and then the
sentence is interrupted. The verb which is
to be supplied with ‘mulie1·es,' δια, 15 ‘ad-
hibebantur!

ipse tamen] Zumpt observes that it is
wonderful (mirum) that, in all the editions
after P. Manutius, a point is put after ‘ ta-
men,’ as if ‘ tamen' and ‘ipse vir' were
purposely separated, though all the ‘sen-
tentiae vis' and ἵ constructionis ratio ' de-
pend on the connexion of these words. Ι
(lon't know what his smaller edition has,
but the English rcprint, which labours 1111.-
der a most vicious punctuation, puts a
comma after ‘tamen'

Zumpt observes,

that by frequent punctuation, not following
reason, but eustom, we separate things which
go together, as is often the case with this
particle—,⁶ tum quum τ’ Zumpt and Ior-

si non tamquam virum, at 1212]
this stands in the English reprint, and I
suppose in the smaller edition of Zumpt.
In the larger edition he follows Madvig,
who writes ‘sed tamquam aemulum,' fol-
lowing R 3. But there is no doubt that
‘ at ² is conformable to the usage of Cicero 3
and it is the reading of V. Zumpt says
that ‘si ' belongs to ‘removisset‚' and the
opposition is this, ‘non virum> and ‘sed
aemulum.’ There is no doubt that ‘ si ' be-
longs to ‘ removisset 3' there is nothing else
for it to belong to. It is true too that ‘ non
—sed ³ are often opposed, and so are *¹ si non
—at.’ Zumpt says that ‘ at ' would do if it
were 111 this form z “ ut eam seeum haberet,
si non tamquam uxorem, at tamquam ami-
cam.’' But in Lib. 3. c. 4, there is “si
non virtute, &e., at sermone . . . ejus de-
lectamini 3³⁹ and in Lib. 4. c. 19, “ si non
in parentis, at in hominum numero puta-
bat? ‘At’ is the true word here, and
‘sed' spoils the sense.—‘ accipit ε’ ‘acce-
pit ' V,
