454 IN O. VERREM

became admissible to the senate aster being
a quaestor, and as he was elected to a
quaestorship by the people, thcir vote in-
directly placed him in the senate. See Pro
Sestio, c. 65, and the note on the Roman
senate.—‘ publice ε’ ‘ on behalf of the state?
See c. 9, and Caesar, B. G. i. 16. Also
Verr. ii. 1. c. 25, where Philodamus admits
his liability to entertain praetors and con-
suls on behalf of his town.

eoeteras nationes,] ‘ Socii et exterae na-
tiones' comprise all people with whom
the Romans had any dealings of any kind.
Madvig (quoted by Klotz) says that the
‘ exterae nationes ' are those whom the
Romans had subdued and made tributary.
This is manifestly a mistake. All who were
not ‘ socii ³ were ‘ exterae nationes,' and the
‘ provinciales ' were included among ‘ socii ’
(Lib. 1. 0. 31, ‘ non provinciae,' &c.). There
were nations which were not ‘ socii,' nor yet
conquered, with whom the Romans had
relations of some kind. Thus Caesar (B.
G. i. 43) speaks of Ariovistus having been
addressed by the title of king, and friend of
the Roman senate. Certainly he was not a
‘socius' like the Aedui, nor did he pay a
tribute. He belonged to the ‘ exterae
gentes? — ‘ et amplissima' Zumpt and
lordan omit.

mmo item Pompeii] They also were
now ‘Ponipeii,' Roman citizens, who had
obtained the ‘ civitas' through the favour
of Cn. Pompeius.

L. frater] His ‘ frater patruelis,' or

cousin Lucius, who accompanied him to
Sicily on this occasion. See Introd. to this
volume. His death is mentioned (Ad Att.
i. 5. Amo. 686).

Tu quid ζα] Here Cicero supposes
some one to have said ‘Amicum enim,' &cn
‘XVeIL it was because you were bringing
our friend to trial? (See Lib. 1. 9, ‘ cau-
sam eni1n.') Cicero answers, ‘ Tu quid
ego privatim,² 310. Hotmann explains ‘pri-
vatim ' to mean ‘ as a single person,' as op-
posed to the senatorian ‘ ordo ;' for he says
‘ publice quidem Cicero negotium hoe gere-
bat.'—-‘ Imminuendo honore ³ is the better
reading, which Graew’us established in place
of ‘ in minuendo honore? The translation
of ‘ interpretabere' is difficult. Hotmann’s
explanation of ‘privatim ’ is right. Cicero
is contrasting himself and his ‘ordo ς’ and
what he means to say is this: ‘Wiu you
disparage the honour that is due to a sena-
tor, in order to show your opinion of my
conduct as a private indin‘dual ?’ for-Cicero,
though a senator, was not sent to Sicily as
a senator, but as a private individua] who
had undertaken to prosecute Verres. This
is what he means to say here, but it may
not be consistent with what he has said
elsewhere. (Lib. 1. c. 6.)

si quid . . affetum] That 15, if the 50-
nate shall call you to account for your be-
haviour in this matter.

ros commisistis,] ‘ presented yourselves
bcf‹›re‚' ‘ trusted yourselveS.’ See Pro
Sestio, c. 54.
