DIVINATIO. 1 5

judicium de pecuniis repetundis est constitutum. Siciliam provin-
ciam C. Verres per triennium depopulatus esse, Siculorum civitates
’ vastasse, domos exinanisse, fana spoliasse dicitur. Adsunt, que-

causam inimici tui sublevabis, de quo non praejudicium sed plane

repetundae is allowed, in consequence of

it is not a ‘ praejudicium‚' but really a ‘judi-
cium ' that is now considered to have been

the ‘postulatio,' demand, of a prosecutor
being admitted (recepta) by the praetor.
If he had been speaking of the establish-
ment of the ‘quaestio perpetua' he would
have said ‘ ins-titutum? See c. 21.

coynitorem juris sak] One man could
represent another, as plaintiff or defendant,
in a suit, and act for him. If such an agent
or attorney was appointed by a party to a
suit for a particular 0350 in the presence of
the opposing party, he was called ‘cog-
nitor’ (Pro Q. Roscio Com. c. 11). It was
not necessary that the ‘ cognitor ' must be
present when he was appointed (Gaius, iv.
83, &c.). The ‘cognitor’ iu all respects
represented the person who had appointed
him. A ‘procurator' was an agent who
was appointed by 1111 absent party (Act. ii.
Lib. 2. c. 2-1), and he 11··15 bound to give
security that his principal would ratify· all
that he did (Gaius, iv. 98; Dig. 46. tit. 8;
Puchta‚ Imtit. ii. ξ 156). Tl1e⁰ter1n‘cog-
nitor’ is only applied to private or civil
suits. Cicero here intends to show that he
represented the Sicilians in every respect,
for every demand 3 110 was their ‘ represen-
tative for the recovery of their just claims?
Asconius has a note 011 ‘ patronus,’ ‘ advo-
catus,’ ‘cognitmffl ‘procurator,’ which is
short, but quite correct. The writer of
this particular note was not Pseudo-
Asconius.

Si id audebis, &c.] “If you shall d ire

made, inasmuch as it is the universal belief
that all the Sicilians have looked out for a
manager of their case to prosecute Verres
for his unlawful acts.’' Orelli has ‘ actorem
me suae causae,’ which was Menard's con-
jecture, but ‘me' is not in the MSS„ nor is
it necessary. Caecilius might deny that
Cicero was selected as the advocate of the
81011ῑ11115, but that would not disprove the
truth of the general opinion that the Sici-
lians had sought an 311100111101· 01011

cate 1135 not Caecilius, at least. The bare
fact of all Sicil3 agrceing to 0110050 501110

further, must be considered a condemnation
of Verres· The word ‘ praejudicium ¹ 01111-
not be translated 111· 1111 English noun. The
name of the Roman form of action called

‘praejudicium‚' or ‘ actio pruejiulicialis! is
derived from the circumstance that it had
no ‘ condemnatio' 115· a consequence, but its
end was to establish the existence of 11 fact,
or facts, · which 1111σ11ῐ5 serve as the founda-
