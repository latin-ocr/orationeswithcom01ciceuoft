LEX VOCONIA. 173

reduced Asses. But the smallness of this sum, if we assume the reduced
ν Asses to be meant, is an argument against the correctness of this inter-
pretation 3 nor can we admit, as one critic at least has assumed, that the
As to which the Lex Voconia refers was the old As ; for, though the time
when the As was reduced to 3¹74- part is uncertain, we know that it was
reduced to 7¹9- before the enactment of the Lex Voconia. The Lex
would of course not refer to a denomination of money which was no
longer in use, but it would refer to the standard of the time, and the
amount would be expressed either in the reduced As, or in Sestertii 3 and
the Leges of this period express amounts of money in Sestertii, not in
Asses. That ‘ aes ' was often used as ageneral term for money, and as a.
legal term, is stated by Ulpian (Dig. 50. 16. 159, “etiam aureos
nummos aes dicimus ”): and the word ‘aes ' is perhaps used in this
general sense in a passage in the ‘De Re Publica’ of Cicero (iii. 10).
According to the terms of the Lex, the prohibition only applied to a
testator who was ‘census’ (Cic. In Verr. Acts'ix. Lib. 1. c. fil—44), ,
that is, to one whose property was ascertained by the census to,
amount to 100‚000 sestertii, if that Le the real sum which was named
in the Lex. But this does not show what census is meant, whether the
last census, or any census after the date of the Lex Voconia ². If we
interpret the Lex strictly, the prohibition did not apply to a testator
who was not ‘ census,’ whether this happened in consequence of his own
neglect or because a census had not been held. It may appear some-
r what singular that the legal efficacy of the prohibition should depend on
an accident, or even that a man might render it inoperative by avoiding
or neglecting to be ‘census’ But the fact is so, according to our
authorities, and we must either reject the evidence because we do not
fully understand the meaning of this provision of the Lex, which is an
uncritical mode of proceeding, or we must accept it, even though we do
not understand it.

In the ease of the daughter of P. Annius Asellus, Cicero contends
that Annius could make his daughter ‘hercs‚’ because he was not
‘census 3’ and he complains of the Ediet of Verres (c. 41), because it
said nothing of the census, and yet the prohibition of the Lex (c. 42)
only applied to the case of a man being ‘census’ Cicero also com-
plains that the Edict of Verres applied to the case of testators, who
died before the Edict was published, and consequently it had a retro-
speetive effect. In both points Cicero's objections are well founded,

though Hotmann² not always a safe authority, attempts to justify
Verres.

² “Neque census esset, nihil amplius, orator dicit, h. e. uunquam ex quo paterfa-
milias sive sui juris finctus est '' (Zumpt).
