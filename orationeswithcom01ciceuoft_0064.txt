46 REPETUNDAE.

modes of proceeding by the words: ‘⁶ de ea re petitio nominisve delatio
esto.''

The penalty of the Lex was double the amount of what the accused
was convicted of having wrongfully taken. There is nothing in the Lex
which shows that exile was added as a penalty, though it appears that
after the passing of this Lex some persons were condemned to exile.
This was the case with T. Albucius Rc2 103, and P. Rutilius Rufus. But
there is a difference of opinion among scholars on this matter of exile.
That any crimina] might leave Rome before sentence was pronounced,
and that this was followed by the ‘aquae et ignis interdictio,’ is well
ascertained3 but this is a different thing from a formal sentence of exile.
After the judgment followed the ‘litis aestimatio' or the assessing of the
amount of damages, whether the accused had gone into exile or not. If
the man who was convicted was unable to pay the damages, or if he was
dead, those were liable to pay to whose hands the money of the criminal
had come (ad quos pervenit), heredes and the like.

The Lex Acilia, proposed by the Tribunus Plebis M’ Acilius Glabrio,
was enacted B.c. 101. Some writers make the Lex Acilia precede the
Servilia in the order of time, to which there is this objection, that the
Acilia is not mentioned in the fragments of the Servilia, while the Cal-
purnia and J unia are mentioned. Besides this, it would not have been
necessary for the Cornelia to restore the second ‘ actio,’ if the Acilia had
preceded the Servilia.

The Acilia did not allow either ‘comperendinatio’ or ‘ampliatio.’
Cicero says (Verr. Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 9): ‘⁴ ego tibi. illam Aciliam legem
restituo, qua lege multi semel accusati, semel dicta causa, semel auditis
testibus condemnati sunt.”

During the Dictatorship of Sulla—(Rc. 81) was enacted the Lex Gor-
nelia, the basis of which was the Servilia. This Lex contained the
provision, that if a provincial governor got or received money for the
purpose of having statues erected to him, he should be liable to a prose-
cution, if the statues were not set up within five years. The aediles
were also forbidden to borrow statues from the provinces for the decora-
tion of their spectacles at Rome, or to take money for this purpose.
These and other regulations are stated to have been contained in the
Cornelia Lex. The penalty of exile was still retained, as it is inferred
from Cicero's expression (Verr. Act. ii. Lib. 2. c. 31), “ retinete hominem
in civitate,” &c., and as it is stated by Asconius (Act. i. c. 13). The
pecuniary damages, which were assessed in the ‘litis aestimatio‚’ after
the condemnation of the accused, were increased to four times the actual
amount of what the accused had wrongfully taken, and payment could
be demanded even from those to whose hands it could be proved that any
part of the ill—gotten money or valuables had come, or as the Romans
