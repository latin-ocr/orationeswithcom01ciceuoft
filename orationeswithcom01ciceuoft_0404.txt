quoniam pater tam negligens ac dissolutus est. Verum huc longius
quam voluntas fuit ab epistola Timarchidi digressa est oratio mea,
qua recitata conclusurum me esse crimen decumanum dixeram ; ex
quo intellexistis innumerabilem frumenti numerum per triennium
aversum a re publica esse ereptumque aratoribus.

maximo atque impudentissimo furto ; de quo dum certa et pauca

Frumentum in Sicilia emere

debuit Verres ex senatusconsulto et ex lege Terentia et Cassia

frumentaria.

Emendi duo genera fuerunt3

unum decumarum 3

alterum, quod praeterea civitatibus aequaliter esset distributum:

crimen decumanum] This is an emen-
dation of Lambinus. The MSS. have
‘crimen decumarum,’ which is an error.
See 0. 66, 77.

70. Terentia et Cassia] This was one
of the Leges Frumentariae, the object of
which was the secui-ing a supply of grain
for Rome. The Lex Terentia Cassia was
enacted in B. C. 73. It is mentioned again

(3.75 and L ib. 5. 0. 21. The purpose of
the‘ 1οΧ,’ it IS said, was to give. authority
for the purch asing of corn with the public
money, and for 1110 retailing it at a fixed
price at Rome. There' is little information
about the provisions of this ‘lex.' The
passages relating to it are collected in
Orelli’s edition of Cicero, Index Legum.

The passage in the Fragments of Sallust
(p. 974, ed. Cort.), “Nisi forte repentina
ista frumentaria lege munia vestra pensan-
tur, qua tamen quiuis modiis libertatem
omnium aestimavere, qui profecto non
amplius possunt alimentis carceris,'' is
supposed to refer to this ‘lex, ·' but there
is nothing in the passage 11111011 5110115
that it does. The passage seems to imply
that the corn there spoken of, the 1110

‘modii' (z ι 111011111), was a gift3 for it is
spoken of 115 1110 price of liberty. Yet it
is stated that the corn was not given
under the provisions of any Lex, before
that of Clodius, but 11 as sold at the price
of 6111 ’15505 for eac‘h 1110(11115.’ (Α50011. 111
Ρ15. c. iv. p. 9, ed. Or.; Schol. Bob. Pro
Sest. c. 25; but see Livy, Ep. 60, <semisse
et triente.') The corn mentioned in the text
was purchased 111 accordance with the pro-
visions of the ‘lex Terentia et Cassia ς’ but
the senate gave the order for each purchase.

This system of buying corn at the pub-
lic eost led to misci-able results. The
markct at Rome was unsteady: scarcity
was often feared, ancl sometimes felt.
The Romans compellcd the Sicilians to

sel] grain at the price which the Romans
gave, and so far the Roman state was
better off than a modern state would
be, which would be compelled to give the
market price if it became a pure-haser.
But this practice must have raised the
price of grain in other parts of Italy, and
indeed to all persons who were not fed by
the state. Arthur Young (Travels in
Franoe, 1787-9, p. 490) has some instruc-
tive remarks on Neckar’s corn-purchases
during his administration. The effect of
his giving notice that he had made an im-
mense purchase in corn, 011 the public
account, was to raise the price imme-
diately. A ‘senatusconsultum' for the
purchasing of a quantity of corn for Rome
was an announcement of scarcity, neces-
sarily followed by a 1150 of price. The
National Assembly of France followed
Neckar's example. They watched over
the suhsistence of the people, and 50 made
or aggravated scarcity. Even now (1861)
the price of bread is fixed at Paris.
unum demeum-um ;] The reading of the
MSS. is either ‘ unum ceterarum decuma-
rum,' 01· ‘unum certarum decumarum?
‘Ceterarum ³ may bc right : the 011101 001-
tainly not. Neither word is in Lg. 42 N.
Hotmann writes ¹ unum alterarum decuma-
rum.’ Klotz has ‘ unum ceterarum decu·
marum? The ‘alterae decumae’ arc meant.
Zumpt thinks that we should perhaps read
‘decumanum ³ for ‘decuma-rum,' which
is probable. After ‘hujus imperati' some
MSS. have ‘ 111 annos singulos ς’ and also
Iordan.
distributum :] This word 15 supposed
to be equivalent to ‘imperatum ς’ but Er-
nesti says that a like use of the word can-
not be found in Cicero. This ‘emptum
frumentum' consisted of a second ‘ decu-
mae ' which was paid for ; and of ‘ impera-
tum frumeutmn,’ an amount required of
