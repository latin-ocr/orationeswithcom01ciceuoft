344 IN O. VERREM

plus lucri nomine eripitur quam quantum omnino frumenti exara·
rant? ad quos tu decumanum Diognetum Venereum misisti, novum
genus publicani. Cur hoc auctore non Romae quoque servi publici
ad vectigalia accedunt? Anno secundo Tissenses HS {U lucri
dare coguntur inviti: tertio anno ffi mod. tritici lucri Diogneto
Venereo dare coacti sunt. Hic Diognetus, qui ex publicis vecti-
galibus tanta lucra facit, vicarium nullum habet, nihil omnino
peculii. Vos etiam nunc dubitate, si potestis, utrum tantum nume-
rum tritici Venereus apparitor istius sibi acceperit an huic exegerit.
Atque haec ex publico Tissensium testimonio cognoscite. 'rasn-
MONIVM PVBLICVM T1ssENSIVM. Obscure, judices, praetor ipse
decumanus est, quum ejus apparitores frumentum a civitatibus
exigant, pecunias imperent, aliquanto plus ipsi lucri auferant quam
quantum populo Romano decumarum nomine daturi sunt. Haec
aequitas in tuo imperio fuit, haec praetoris dignitaS, ut servos
Venereos Siculorum dominos esse velles. Hic delectus, hoc dis-
crimen te praetore fuit ut aratores in servorum numero essent,
servi in publicanorum.

XXXIX. Quid Amestratini miseri impositis ita magnis decumis
ut ipsis reliqui nihil fieret, nonne tamen numerare pecunias coacti
sunt? Addicuntur decumae M. Caesio, quum adessent legati

is Amestratus. The name occurs also in
Stephanus, but 110 where else. The posi-
tion of Mistretta, where there are some
ruins, 111 the interior south of Halesa, may
be the site. But there is no evidence at

38. accedunt ?] V and others have ‘ ac-
cedant? ‘ Hoc auctore ' 11103115, when Diog-
netus sets such an example. ‘ Accedere
ad vectigalia’ signifies, to become farmers

of the public revenue. The Thermitani
(c. 42) gave Venuleius a handsome sum
‘ne accedat,' that he should not meddle
with the contract. Communities (res pub-
licae) often owned slaves, who were ‘servi
publici ς’ and the Venerei were of this
class.

Tissenses] The city is Tissae (Τίσσαι
01 Τίασα), from which the Roman Ethuic
name is regularly formed. The site of this
little place does not appear to be certain.
Zumpt, in his map, places it west of Tauro-
menium, 011 the river Onobalas, which flows
on the north-eastern base of Aetna. But
the site is unknown. Ptolcmy places it
about Aetna. V has ‘Atheniensibus,’
another proof that it cannot always be
followed.

vicarium] This expression and ‘pecu-
lium’ are explained Lib. 1. c. 36. Cicero
means to say that Diognetus was a slave,
and one even of the lower kind, who had
no ‘ vicarius ' and no ‘peculium.'

39. Amestratini] The name of the place

all for this supposition except the resem-
blance of name. The fact of the Calactini
being required to deliver their grain at
Amestratus (c. 43) is 110 evidence of these
two places being near to one another, for
the Siculi were often required by Verres to
deliver their corn in places remote from
their residence. There are coins of Ames-
tratus.

A name Mytistratus occurs in Stepha-
nus, Diodorus (23. c. 9), Polybius, and
Zonaras. Pliny has the Ethnic name Mu-
tustratini. The site of Mytistratus is
entirely unknown, and it is a probable con-
jecture that Mytistratus and Amestratus
are the same place. 1 am not awai-e that
there are any coins of MytistratuS. The
difference of name between Amestratus
and Mytistratus is slight5 and if Ste-
phanus is the only author who mentions
both names, that is a very small argument
against the identity. ”
