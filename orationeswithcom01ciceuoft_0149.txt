Verres the tutor of his son, who was ‘ im-
pubes‚' that 15, 1111(101· 1110 age when he
could do legal acts3 and therefore he re—
quired, according to Roman usage, a ‘tutor,’
for the protection of his property and his
interests. The ward was called ‘pupillus ς’
that is, ‘pupillus ' is the legal name of an
‘ impubes ' whose property is under the
care of a ‘tutor.'
sic· copiose] Ernesti thought that ’00-
piose ’ was a gloss, but without any reason.

remarks, ‘ Sic hoc modo pro tam adhiberi
rarum est! Comp. Act. i. 0. 6, ‘sic erat
humilis . . ut videretur.' ‘ Sic' is often
used in this way ; and there is no use in
saying that it is used for ‘ tam.'
occuparat] This means, ‘ he had laid

‘p‹›puli,’ the provinci. 115. Ηο went out for

Cic. Ad Att. v. 21. Asconius says : “ Be-

grapha there is this difl'ercnce, that in the
other it is usual for those things or trans-
actions only to be inserted which have ac-
tually occurred , 111 syngraphae, an agree-
'mcnt (pactio) enters which is even 0011-
- trary to fact (contra fidem veritatis), and
money which has never passed (11011 11111110-
rata), or has 1101 passed to the full amount,
is entered according to the plcasure of the
parties at the time, in conformity with tho
usage and practice of the Greeks: other

110-1111105(1111)111110)111·0 used to be kept of

“the one part only ς syngraphae, signed hy
the hand of each party, are delivered to
ε’ each party to keep.’' 'l'he passage of Gaius
(iii. ξ 134) ’15 as follows ε “ Praeterea litte-

rarum obligatio fieri videtur chirographis
et syngraphis, id est, 51 quis debere 50 aut
daturum se scribat ; ita scilicet si eo nomine
stipulatio 11011 fiat. Quod genus obliga-
tionis proprium peregrinorum est-'³

This distinction of Asconius between
‘syngrapha' and ⁶ chirographum ³ does not
appear to be true. ‘ Syng1·apha,' in the old
Greek law, did not denote a particular kind
of contract, but 15 the general name for
any written evidence of an agreement, a
sense which it had in common with other
tcrms which were occasionally used. (Ci-
cero, Phil. ii. 37, vol. iv.). The Romans
found such writings in 1150 111 111011· Greek
provinces, and also the rule of law esta-
blished, that a man might sue upon any
written agreement, without reg-ard to its
form. ‘Chirograplnnn,' in Cicero’s time,
meant any writing, particularly 0110 111 1110
handwriting of the person whom it spe-
cially concerned, bnt it had 110 particular
reference to legal transtu-tiens. In the
second century of the Christi-in ae1··i,tho

limited 10 the case 011 10an5and the 111 0
words, 5111111111110 and ‘chirograp111,'
were generally used indiflcrently. So it was
111 1110 time of Gaius; and in the provinces
a man might sue 011 a contract contained in
any informal writing‚ which was contrary
to the rnle of Roman law (Savigny, Ver-
1111501110 Schriften, vol. i.‚ Literalcontrawt
der Romer).

familiam memnona] ‘ Familia ¹ 15 here
taken in its wider sense, which includes a
man’s slaves. ‘Familia et pecunia' com-
prehended all that a nia-n had. “ Familiam

that ‘literam’ should be ‘libellam 5' not
