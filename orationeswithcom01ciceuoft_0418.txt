400 IN O. VERREM

novam rem totam atque indignam videri. Ad eos me scribas re-
voca, si placet: noli hos colligere, qui nummulis corrogatis de ne-
potum bonis ac de scenicorum eorollariis, quum decuriam emerunt,
ex primo ordine explosorum in secundum ordinem civitatis se
venisse dicunt. Eos scribas tecum disceptatores hujus criminis
habebo qui istos scribas moleste ferunt esse. Tametsi, quum in eo
ordine videamus esse multos non idoneos, qui ordo industriae pro*-
positus est et dignitati, quid mirabimur turpes esse aliquos quo

cuivis pretio licet pervenire Ρ

de nepotum bonis] Zumpt says, “Ve-
tustiores libri scripti editique omnes bonis :³²
but he writes donis, for which his reasons
seem very insufficient. Cicero says that
they had picked up their money from
spendthrifts (nepotes), and from the pay,
perhaps (corollariis), ofactors (scenicorum).
Manutius explains ‘scenicorum' to be
‘spectantium scenicos ludos ,·' but Ι know
of no case in which ‘scenici,' used thus
absolutely, means any thing except actors.
The learned commentator, no doubt, saw a
difficulty in the words ‘ de nepotun1,’ &cu ς
for if these men got their money partly
from the ‘bona' or ‘ dona' of extravagant
people, and partly from the ‘ corollaria ³ of
‘ scenici,' then the ‘scenici' and ‘nepotes'
are co-ordinated as two classes of persons,
out of whom these men got the means of
buying a ‘decuria' This is a difficulty which
cannot be got rid of, nor explained by those
who, like Zumpt and many others, consider
the men of whom Cicero speaks to be ‘ sce-
nici,' or actors. NVhatever then be the
sense of ‘de scenicorum corollariis,' it
signifies a source of gain, which Cicero puts
on the same footing as ‘ de nepotum bonis.'
There is another difficulty in ‘ex primo
ordine explosorum) ‘ Explosorum ’ is taken
to be the genitive plural of the passive par-
ticiple, and to signify that these men,
originally actm-s, and poor actors, in the
first class of those who were hissed off
the stage, after buying a ‘decuria,’ think
that they have attained the second ‘ordo ³
in the state, or have attained equestrian
rank. But, if my explanation so far is
right, this cannot be the meaning of ‘ex-
plosorumss which I take to be the genitive
plural of ‘ exploso& though I find no
other example of the noun. The sense of
‘explosus’ is well known. Horat. 1 Sat.
x. 7 6 :—

“Nam satis est equitem mihi plaudere,
ut audax
Contemptis aliis explosa Arbuscula dixit.''

These men were ‘explosores' at the thea-
tre, noise-makerS, hissers, and so forth3
and perhaps the ‘ scenici ’ paid them to keep
quiet. The ‘corollaria' were crowns or
chaplets given to the actors, originally of
flowers, it is said; afterwards, crowns of
thin metal, silvered or gilded, were given
them 3 and afterwards the word seems to
have got the meaning of money (crown
money), for it is nothing unusual to disguise
a money payment under another name.
Zumpt's remark on the passage seems to be
quite wide of the mark ; he takes the peo-
ple to be aetors. Klotz takes them not to
be actors; and I suppose that he takes
‘explosorum’ to be a noun ; for he says:
“diese Lente, meint nun Cicero, hatten
sich in die Decurie eingekauft und waren
somit von dem Stande der gemeinen Schina-
rotzer (ex primo ordine explosorum) in den
zweiten Stand (in secundum ordinem ci-
vitatis), also in den Ritterstand iibergegan—
gen.” This passage presents considerable
difficulties; and with this explanation I
recommend it to others who may be more
successful than I have been.

For ‘ explosorum ' V has ‘ expilosoporum,’
which seems to be purely a blunder, and to
promise nothing for the pains of looking
into it. (See Lib. 4. c. 16, note.)

quid mirabimur] V, Klotz. The usual
reading is ⁶ mirabinmr.’

80. terdecies] There is good authority
for ‘ terdecies ' or ‘ terdeciens? though most
of the MSS. have ‘tredecies’ Hotmann
says that ‘terdecies’ is the same as ‘tri-
cies,' which, as Zumpt observes, requires
to be proved. Lambinus would write
‘ quatuordecies: because one twenty-fifth
