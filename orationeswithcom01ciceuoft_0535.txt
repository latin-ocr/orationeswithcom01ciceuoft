Atque haec Sappho sublata quantum desiderium

Sicily, we may infer, was a strong-built,
brawny fellow, and that is enough for
Cicero's sarcasm. He was a thief and a
fellow of no principle, but 118 had taste:
that is clear.

The common reading is ‘ ad deferenda,'
which does not express what Cicero means
to say. Besides this, R 3 have ‘ ad ferenda,'
which does express Cicero's meaning. ‘ Fe-
renda' expresses what has been expressed
before by ‘portare,’ c. 53, ‘ si portare
potuisset!

epigramma Graecum] The word ‘ epi-
gramma' is well understood in the Greek
sense. It is something in verse, short and
pertinent, which tells us in few words a
great deal. The Greeks excelled in this
style of composition, the highest style of
all ς for to express well in few words some-
thing that is worth remembering is a work
of art. The term is as old as Herodotus,
and the example is the simplest possible
(Lib. vi. 58) z

Ἀμφιτρύων μ’ ἀνέθηκε νέων ἀπὸ Τη-

λεβοᾶων.
Herodotus (vii. 228> has other examples.
The best is that on the Spartans who died
at Thermopylae, which Cicero has trans-
lated, Tuscul. Disput. i. 42. There are
many ‘epigrammata ' on Sappho. Why
that of Plato should be selected as the oue
alluded to here (Zumpt), I don’t know. It
is in the Antholog. Brunck. 1. 171, and of
Brodaeus, p. 135, and is the best of the set ;
if for no other reason, because it is the

shortest ε

Ἐννέα τὰς μούσας φασίν τινες· ὡς ὀλι-
ώ ως·

Ἠνίδῖ κςιὶ Σαπφώ Λεσβόθεν ἡ δεκάτη.
Ι conjecture that the ‘ epigrannua’ of the
text was something more than this.

non sustulisset] This is the common
reading, and the MSS. and the editions offer
no help, says Zumpt. All the MSS. have
‘uon sustulisset’ (Iordan). Klotz keeps
the common reading. Zumpt says of this
‘ non,’ ‘sententiam prorsus evertit,' and he
must descend to conjecture. His conjec-
ture, or rather that of Herelius, is ‘ una‚’

which he adoptS, and Iordan also. Gara-
toni would simply strike out the ‘non

One of the two things must be done, hs
says. Let us see if there is not a third.
Let·it stand, and see what it means. I
don't take ‘ quod' to be governed, as they
call it, by ‘ sustulisset? That is the origin
of the blunder. ¹ Quod ' is used as it often
is ; it refers to ‘unam literam Graecam.'
Cicero might have simply said ‘quod si
iste unam . . . scisset ς’ and in fact he does
say it, for he has only interposed certain
words between ‘ quod' and ‘si,’ and instead
of placing ‘ quod si ’ together, as he often
does, he has separated them; but that
does not alter the meaning. Cicero says
this: ‘The statue of Sappho was of excel-
lent workmanship, and there was a very
famous inscription cut on the pedestal ;
now this inscription, this scholar of yours
and ape of the Greeks, he who is so excel·
lent a judge of these matters, in fact the
only judge, if he had understood a single
Greek letter, he would not have carried
off the statue. For now what is written
on, the bare pedestal tells us what was
there, and shows that it has been taken
away.' 1 admit that the objection against
‘ nou ’ is very specious; almost convincing
on the first impression. The inscription
contained something which showed that
there ought to be a statue above it. The
inscription and the statue were parts of one
whole. If then Verres had carried ost* the
two together, there would have been the
statue and the inscription entire ; the iu-
tegrity of the work would have been pre-
served. But if Verres kept the work
entire, statue and inscription, 118 would
have been betrayed3 for the thing aud the
inscription, 1 assume, were appropriate to
the place. At any rate, it was notorious
where it had been ; and, if kept entire,
the evidence of the theft would have been
perpetuated by the integrity of the work.
Well; but he might have kept the statue
and removed or destroyed the basis, as he
did in another case (c. 35). True; he
might have done so ; nor does Cicero deny
it. He simply says that, if he had under-
