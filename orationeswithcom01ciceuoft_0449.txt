FORMULA OOTAVIANA. 431

The introduction of the ‘Actio quod metus causa' is attributed by
Cicero to a Praetor Octavius, who is conjectured to be the L. Octavius
γ who was consul B.c. 75. If this was the man, he was probably ‘ praetor ’
about four years earlier, or Rc. 79. Accordingly, the introduction of
this Actio would belong to the year B.c. 79, two years after the enact-
ment of the Lex Cornelia de Repetundis, and two years before the
introduction of the ‘Actio Vi bonorum raptorum‚’ by the praetor M.
Lucullus. This confirms Rudorff's opinion, which he establishes on
other grounds, that the action ‘ Quod metus eausa ' was not founded on,
or derived from, the ‘Actio Vi bonorum raptorum,' as some have sup-
posed. After Sulla’s death, B.c. 78, this ‘Actio quod metus ’ was applied
to compes persons to make restitution, who during the time of Sulla
had by violent means got possession of other persons' property. Cicero
appears to allude to this application of the Actio by that active and
excellent Praetor, C. Octavius, the father of him who was afterwards
the emperor Augustus: “cogebantur Sullani homines quae per vim
et metum abstulerant reddere '’ (Ad Qu. Fr. i. 1. c. 7). ,The edict into
which the Octaviana Formula was received, applied to the case of
agreements (Cicero, De Off. iii. 243 Dig. 2. 14. 7. ξ 7), to cases where
Restitutio was claimed, in consequence of a man having sustained loss
by having been prevented from doing something (Dig. 4. 6. 1. ξ 1);
and, lastly, to cases where Restitutio was claimed, in consequence of
a man’s rights having been impaired by acts done under compulsion.
The clause applicable to the last case ran thus: “ Quod metus causa
gestum erit, ratum nou habebo ;’' but the original form was, “ Quod vi
metusve causa'’ (Dig. 4. 2. 1). Under this head, Octavius declared
that he would allow an action for fourfold the amount of the loss sus-
tained by this compulsion3 and an action, not only against the person
who bad been guilty of the violence, but also against any innocent
person who had got direct pecuniary profit in consequence of the aet of
violence.

This measure of Octavius was caused by the circumstances of the
times. During the tyranny of the Dictator Sulla, acts of violence had
become so common, and so many persons had been deprived of their
property by threats, and other illegal proceedings, that a strongcr
remedy seemed to be required than a simple action (condictio), to which
however a person might still have recourse. After the publication of the
new Formula, the two remedies subsisted together. As citizens now
practised with respect to other citizens the same unlawiul means that
Roman ‘ magistratus’ practised against provincials‚ there was a reason sor
applying what Cicero calls the principles of the Lex SocialiS, the Lex
de Repetundis (Divin. c. 5), to the case os Roman citizens oppressing
their fellow-citizens. The Formula of Octavius having been introduced
