546 IN O. VERREM

re gerunda celeritatem, neque ad hujus qui postea fuit singulare
consilium, neque ad Paulli rationem ac disciplinam, neque ad C.
Marii vim atque virtutem, sed ad aliud genus imperatorum sane
diligenter retinendum et conservandum—quaeso, cognoscite. Itine-
rum primum laborem qui vel maximus est in re militari, judices, et
in Sicilia maxime necessarius, accipite quam facilem sibi iste et
jucundum ratione consilioque reddiderit. Primum temporibus
hibernis ad magnitudinem frigorum et ad tempestatum vim ac
fluminum praeclarum hoc sibi remedium compararat. Urbem Syra-
cusas elegerat3 cujus hic situs atque haec natura esse loci coelique
dicitur ut nullus unquam dies tam magna ac turbulenta tempestate
fuerit quin aliquo tempore ejus diei solem homines viderint. Hic
ita vivebat iste bonus imperator hibernis mensibus ut eum non
facile non modo extra tectum, sed ne extra lectum quidem quis-
quam videret: ita diei brevitas conviviis, longitudo noctis stupris

et flagitiis conterebatur.

as Zumpt's, except that they have ‘ne qui
diutiuSss &a But these editors don’t agree
about the interpretation. The ‘ ad,' accord-
ing t0 Graevius and Orelli, means ‘in com-
parison with' (i111Vergleich-—mit); and the
passages Pro Deiot. 8, ‘ Veteres cred0‚' &a 3
and De Or. ii. 6, ‘nihil ad Persiu1n‚'
are quoted. Zumpt objects to this: his
explanation is the following: “Cognoscite
euni, qualis fuerit, non ut Maximum ali-
quem aut Scipionem aut Marium sed ut
alind quoddam novum genus imperatoris
in civitate diligenter retineatis.” This, I
think, is nearer the meaning, and it is un-
important whether the ‘ ad ' before ‘ aliud ³
is added or omitted. I prefer keeping it.
There only then remains the difference be-
tween ‘imperatoris ⁹ and ‘imperatorum ς’
and the question whether the sentence be-
gins with ‘ ne diutius? or ‘ne quis diutius,'
and ‘ non ad.² I have adopted the reading
of Orelli's larger edition, with the punctua-
tion slightly altered. The meaning is this :
‘ That in such a dearth of brave men, you
may no longer be strangers to such an Im-
perator—I pray you, make yourselves ac-
quainted with him? The words ‘non ad
Q. Maximi . . retinendum et conservandum ²
are thrown in parenthetically, and I explain
them as Zumpt doeS.—‘ hujus ' is the
younger Africanus

fluminum] The rains in Sicily are often
very heavy in the winter, and owing to the
hilly nature of the country and their short
course the streams become very impetuous
and difficult to pasS. The regular rains do

not commence till November, between
which month and March they fall often in
heavy torrents. “The violent rains that
deluge the island at this season swell the
rivers, damage the roads, and set the Fiu-
mare running: these are torrents, occa-
sioned by the waters descending from the
m ountains into deep ravines, through which
they rush with iinpetuosity into the sea,
carrying every thing before theim-The

ing, the baduess of the roads, and the want
of bridges, render travelling in the winter

ticable’' (Smyth’s Sicily, p. 7). Swinburne
(Travels in the Two SicilieS, ii. 266) de-
scribes the curious way in which he crossed
the Halycus (Platani) when it was swollen
by the winter rains.

solem] This happy climate, where the
sun is seen every day in the year, is also
attributed to Rhodes by Pliny (ii. 62), and
to Alexandria by Ammianus Marcellinus
(xxii. 16). Seneca, in the consolation to
Marcia (c. 17), says the same of Syracuse,
but 116 gives a bad account of the summer
climate. Compare Livy, xxv. 25.—-‘ quin
. . viderent’ is the common reading and
that of Ernesti. Zumpt wonders that he
did not see that it ought to be ‘ viderint?
Madvig, quoted by Orelli, remarks ε “ nulla
est hic temporum historica, quam dicunt,
consecutio, sed absolute unam certam defi-
nit-amque rem omnino factam dicit.”
