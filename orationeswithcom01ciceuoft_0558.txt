540 IN O. VERREM

Verum de ista furandi praedandique ratione nihil dico: de hac
imperatoria jam tua laude disputo.
VI. Quid ais, bone custos defensorque provinciae? Tu quos

servos arma capere ac bellum facere in Sicilia voluisse cognoras et
de consilii sententia judicaras‚ hos ad supplicium jam more majorum
traditos, et ad palum alligatos, ex media morte eripere ac liberare
ausus es, ut quam damnatis crucem servis fixeras, hanc indemnatis
videlicet civibus Romanis reservares P Perditae civitates despe-
ratis jam omnibus rebus hos solent exitus exitiales habere, ut
damnati in integrum restituantur, vincti solvantur, exules redu-
cantur, res judicatae rescindantur. Quae quum accidunt, nemo est
quin intelligat ruere illam rem publicam: haec ubi eveniunt, nemo
est qui ullam spem salutis reliquam esse arbitretur. Atque haec
sicubi facta sunt, facta sunt ut homines populares aut nobiles sup-
plicio aut exilio levarentur: at non ab iis ipsis qui judicassent3 at
non statim3 at non eorum facinorum damnati quae ad vitam et ad
fortunas omnium pertinerent. Hoc vero novum et ejusmodi est ut
magis propter reum quam propter rem ipsam credibile videatur, ut
homines serVOS, ut ipse qui judicarat, ut statim e medio supplicio

the ‘nobiles.' In this passage the ‘no-
biles’ and the ‘ populares’ are put in op-
position, as the two rival parties in a state,

6. Quid ais, effen] A sarcastic address,
such as a man would use in ordinary life.
Sc Terence savS, ‘bone custos, salve, colu-

men vero familiae’ (Phormio, ii. 3, 57)
⁴ more majorum] A usual phrase. See
Caesar, B. G. vi. 443 Sueton. Nero, 49.
The‘ mos majorum’ 11· as different in dif-
ferent cases3 for slaves it was flogging
first and then crucifixion. See c. 9, “tot
supplicia. in improbos more majorum con-
stitutaff’
et ad palum αἷῑίραΐος,] Zumpt omits
these words in his lar ger edition; and
Ior dan also, 11110 says that they are only' m
the dett. They have been used above.
Cicero might repeat them for the purpose
of effect. The men were tied to be flogged
perhaps. See e. 3.—‘ indemnatis :' see c. 61.
exitus exitiales] Klotz cites a passage
from De Leg. Agr. ii. 4: “qui civitatum
afflictarum perditis jam rebus extremi exi-
tiorum solent esse exitus ;” but Orelli thinks
that this passage is corrupt.
in integrum restituantur, .
timu] See the Index.
populares aut nobiles]
biles ’ is explained elsewhere.
is a common Roman term to express the
leaders of the ‘ populus ³ in the sense which
the word had in Cicero's time, or those who
affected to consult the interests of the many

. rescindan-

The term ‘no-
‘ Populares ’

but Cicero generally contrasts ‘ populares ’
with ‘optimates‚’ the best people in the
state, as they called themselves, the con-
servative party, which consisted of the se-
nate, the rest of the nobility, and the
Equites; in fact, all who attached them-
selves to the party. Yet as ‘ popularis ³ is
one who favours the ‘ populus,' of whatever
rank he might be, it often happened that
one of the ‘ nobiles ³ chose the popular side,
as the best means of promoting his own in-
terests; and thus, though a ‘nobilis‚’ he
would not be one of the ‘ optimates,’ but a
‘ popularis.’ Cicero on several occasions
explains the terms ‘ optimates ' and ‘ popu-
lares,’ and gives to each the complexion
which suits his purpose (Pro Sestio, 0. 45, 65 3
Pro Cluentio, 0. 34 ; De leg. Agr. ii. c. 4).
Thus his §popularis homo’ is sometimes
the same as ‘ turbulentus? Machiavelli
(Istor. Fiorent. iii.) uses the same terms,
‘ gli nomini Popolari e i Nobili‚' and cha-
racterizes them with his usual preeision.
Iordan following R 3 reads ‘ populares ac
nobiles,5 and he says‘ ‘opponuntur homines
populares ae nobile-s· (i. e. qui iidem sunt
nobiles) hominibus servis, i. e. homines
nobili loco nati et apud populum gratiosi

as opposed to the interests of the few, of hominibus infimae condicionis‚'’ &c-
