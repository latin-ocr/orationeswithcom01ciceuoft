been supposed that there 1135 311 appeal
from the judgment of a ‘judex’ to the
superior judgment of the praetor who had
appointed him, but there is want of evi-
dence in the republican period to prove
this. Cicero reproaches Verres for having
reserved to himself by his edict the power
of deciding on the judgments of the ‘ju-
dices' (Savigny, System, &c., vi. ξ 284).

Seleeti ex conventu aut ege] Cicero has
just said that in certain cases ‘judices ’
ought to be selected from the ‘ conventus'
of Roman citizens, that is, from those
Romans who used to meet at a certain place
at certain times, for the settlement of all
legal matters and the transacting of other
business, for which the people within a cer-
tain district resorted to a 111(οᾶ place. The
word ‘ conventus,' which literally means ‘ a
coming together,' was used also to denote
the place of meeting ; the ‘ forum' (c. 15),
to which the inhabitants of a given district
must resort (convenire). The word ‘con-
ventus ³ also means the whole district, the
inhabitants of which used to meet at a 111(οᾶ

lace.

p XVhen Cicero says that no ‘judices’ were
selected from the ‘ conventus' or proposed
from the ‘ negotiatores, ³ he may mean
such ‘negotiatores’ as 11 ere present only
accidentally and were not considered as a
part of the‘ conv entus> that is, as perma-
nently residing within the district. When
he afterwards says ‘de conv entu 30 nego-
ti·1toribus,' the two are still distinguished,
though spoken of as being together.

There has been much„ discussion about
this passage. The question 15, what 15 the

‘conv entus' to which‘ selecti' applies. The

‘ conventus civium Romanorum,³ says Ma-
nutius. Not the ‘ conventus civium Roma-
norum,’ says Zumpt, but ‘ Sicularum civi-
tatum ;³ and he gives his reason for his
opinion at some length. ‘ Conventus ³ is a.
general term, and, as already shown, it
has several 5011505. Ι 500 110 reason why

‘conventus ' may not be taken in its most
general sense here without limiting it to
‘ cives Romani ³ or Sicilians. In certain
cases, as Cicero has said, ‘selecti judices'
were taken from the ‘ civium Romanorum
conventus ;' in other cases mentioned be-
fore, a ‘ civis Romanus ³ or a Sicilian might
be a ‘judex‚³ and nothing is there said of
the ‘ conventus.' The plain interpretation
of the words ‘ selecti ex conventu aut pro-
positi ex negotiatoribus ' requires the ‘ con-
ventus' and the ‘negotiatores’ to be con-
sidered as two bodies, from which ‘judices'
might be taken. Why the ‘ negotiatores’
are ethus opposed to the‘ conv entus? I do

little strange. The question is, ‘ What
kind of a Cohors do you suppose that there
