mission to wait for his ‘ quaestor‚' who was
Verres himself. But this is not in favour

39. Quaestorem se 150] The reading
‘ quaestores,' of Orelli and Iordan is a cor-

rection of Lambinus, according to Zumpt, of Zumpt’s argument 3 for, if Dolabella

who explains ‘ quaestorem ³ to be ‘ alterum
quaestorem,' one of the Sicilian ‘ quae-
stors,’ for there were two ‘ quaestors ' for
Sicily. But shortly after we have ‘ verum
quaestores—venerunt ;' and the correction
of Lambinus seems probable enough. It
is also the reading of Asconius Zumpt
observes that it was much more usual for a
‘ quaestor’ to give in his accounts without
his ‘ praetor,’ than for the ‘praetor ' with-
out his ‘ quaestor.' And he proves this by
stating that ‘ praetors ’ or ‘ consuls ' often
stayed more than a year in a province,
while the ‘quaestors’ were changed an-
nually 3 and so it appears that ‘ quaestors'
generally rendered their accounts without
their ‘ praetor? But this is very indifferent
arguing, though the conclusion may be true.
Zumpt asks, if all ‘ praetors ³ had done
what Cicero says that they could do, give
in their accounts without waiting for their
‘ quaestor,’ with what show of right could
Verres have said in the senate, that he
was waiting for one of his ‘quaestors P’
'Phe answer is, that it might be with no
show of right, but a great show of impu-
dcnce. Dolabella, said Verres, obtained per-

had this allowed him (impetrarat), it is
clear that it was a favour3 and, instead of
citing the case of Dolabella, Verres should
have appealed to the general practice.

Omen] A Roman mode of expression
which is very difficult to translate. Verres
urged that Dolabella had obtained what he
asked for ; and Dolabella was afterwards
tried and convicted. The senate was better
pleased with the instance which Verres
cited than with his argument, for they
hoped, as Cicero would have us suppose,
that the precedent of Dolabella might be
made complete by Verres being convicted
also.

PR. δια] (ΡΒ. ET PROPR.,' the reading
of most of the MSS„ seem to be the abbre-
viations for ‘praetori' and ‘propraetori.'
Orelli’s text is ‘ pr. p. r. pecuniae redactae?
But ‘pecuniae redactae' is not 'm the
MSS. ς and, if these words were, ‘p. r.'
cannot mean ‘populo Romano‚' as some
have supposed; for ‘pecuniae redactae?
as Zumpt observes, is the same as
‘ exactae?
