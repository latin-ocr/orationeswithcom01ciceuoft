AGT. II. LIBER TERTIUS. 403

magnitudine pecuniae, tum injuriae genere quemvis debet com-
- movere3 tum vero eo magis quod ad hoc crimen non ingeniosa
aliqua defensio sed improbissima confessio comparatur. Nam
quum ex senatusconsulto et ex legibus frumentum in cellam ei
sumere liceret, idque frumentum senatus ita aestimasset, quaternis
HS tritici modium, binis hordei, iste numero ad summam tritici
adjecto tritici modios singulos cum aratoribus ternis denariis aesti-
mavit. Non est in hoc crimen, Hortensi, ne forte ad hoc meditere,
multos saepe viros bonos fortes et innocentes cum aratoribus et cum
civitatibus frumentum in cellam quod sumi oporteret aestimasse, et
pecuniam pro frumento abstulisse. Seio quid soleat fieri: scio
quid liceat. Nihil quod ante fuerit in consuetudine bonorum nunc
in istius facto reprehenditur. Hoc reprehendo, quod, quum in
Sicilia HS binis tritici modius esset, ut istius epistola ad te missa
declarat, summum HS ternis, id quod et testimoniis omnium et
tabulis aratorum planum factum antea est, tum iste pro tritici
modiis singulis denarios ternos ab aratoribus exegit.

LXXXII. Hoc crimen est, ut intelligas non ex aestimatione
neque ex ternis denariis pendere crimen, sed ex conjunctione

bounds to his illegal conduct, extorted, as
it appeam, for every ‘modius' which hc
was entitled to buy, three ‘denarii,' or
twelve ‘sesterces‚’ that is, he got all this
money for nothing; and he got it in re-
spect of a much larger number of ‘ modii ’
than hc was entitled to demand. But
compare what Cicero says e. 85, 87.

in cellam quod] Zumpt places a comma
after ‘ frmnent1nn‚' and another after ‘opor-
teret ;' and he says: “conjunximus (in
cellam quod), mutata interpunctione, nam
sumi per sc nihil est. De postposito pro-
nomine relativo, vid. ad cap. 952⁹ llis
remark on c. 95 is 011 ‘idem qui fecerint?
If we must have pointing, no doubt the
point must be before ‘in cellam;' but 1
cannot understand how any person who lias
attended to the order of Latin will be
helped by this pair of commas, On the
contrary, a person who is awenstmned to
read Latin straight forward, as he does a
modern language, and to ‹·onsider that it
stands in the right order, a fact which l
suppose nobody will dispute, will feel these
points rather a hindrancc than 11 help.

82. eonjmwtione] There, is no dispute¹
about the meaning of this passage. The
ofl'enec of Verres did not eonsist simply in
the fact that he took money instead of
corn, or simply 111 the fact that hc took
three ‘denarii' for each ‘modius ‚·' but it

consisted in the combined fact of the state
of the harvest, or the price of grain (an-
nona), and the sum that he received. All
the MSS. have ‘conjunctione’ except Lg.
42, which has ‘ conjectione 3' “perpetua
eorum verborum confusione '’ (Zumpt).
Klotz has ‘conjectione,' and he explains
the passage in the same way as Zumpt,
with this remark: “that thejoint considera-
tion of the then price of grain, and of the
valnation of the Praetor, is a ‘conjectio
annonae atque amstimationisj is of itself
manifest to the intelligent reader‚ and we
have no occasion to spend more words in
defenee of this reading of the hest MS..
which, however, Zumpt has rejecied.''
lt may be true that ⁴ conjectio' eun be thus
used, but Klotz might have given us a few
exaunpleffi if there are any, of ‘ conjectio ¹
thus used with reference to two things.
Orelli's reading and the common reading
is ‘ ex eoauetione,’ whichaccording to Zumpt
first appears in the edition of Victorius, and
he does not know whether it is not a typo-
graphica] error. Whatever is the origin of
it, the reading has been perpetuated, and
the word ‘ eoauetio ' is put in the lexieons.
Thus it appears in the excellent lexicon of
Forcellini, where there is an attempt to
explain it. Τ 110 passage, even in the Ger-
man edition of 1⁴*urlanett0's Foreellini, is
read thus: ‘cx coauctionc annonae atque
