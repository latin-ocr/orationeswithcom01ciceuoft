210 IN C. VERREM

Chelidonis sinu in provinciam profectus esset Veneris nomine quae-
sisse videtur ? Accipite aliam in minore pecunia non minus impu-
dentem calumniam. Sosippus et Philocrates fratres simt Agyri-
nenses. Horum pater abhinc duo et XX annos est mortuus, in
cujus testamento quodam loco si commissum quid esset, multa
erat Veneri. Ipsos xx annos, quum tot interea praetores, tot quae-
stores, tot calumniatores in provincia fuissent, hereditas ab his
Veneris nomine petita non est. Verres cognoscit: pecuniam per
Volcatium accipit fere HS cccc millia ab duobus fratribus. Mul-

torum testimonia audistis antea.
ut egentes inanesque discederent.

is no etymological objection to ‘Vene-
reus.' ‘ Venerei,' as we have seen, is the
name of the slaves and freedmen of the
temple of Venus Erycina. The note of
Asconius is, “Alludit ad nomen, quod
hirundo, quam ehelidon Graeci vocant,
veris, id est temporis veris, sit amica.'’
There is no sense in this 3 but if we adopt
the almost certain correction of Creuzer
and Moser, ‘ veri, id est tempori Veneris,'
there is sense in the scholium, and pro-
bably the true explanation. Such a play
on words is quite in Cicero's style. See
the note in Creuzer and Moser.

Agyrinenses] Agyrium was one of the
oldest towns of the Siculi, on a hill near
the river Cyamosorus, north-east of Henna,
and west of Centuripae. The modern city
is S. Filippo d'Argirb. It is mentioned
again Lib. 3. c. 27. It had the finest
theatre in the island, after that of Syra-
cuse (Diod. xvi. 83).

quodam loeo . . . commissum] Asconius
correctly explains ‘commissum ³ to be some-
thing done or omitted to be done contrary
to the will of a testator, which commission
or omission brought some pecuniary loss
on the ‘ heres? ‘ Quodam loco ³ means ‘in
a certain passage in the vm'll!

Ipsos XX annos,] The reading of 4,
F M and of Asconius is ‘ipso vigesimo
anno 5' and his note is ‘praescriptio tem-
poris,’ by which he appears to mean that
if twenty years had elapsed, any claim of
the temple would have been bai-red by
time. But there was no ‘ praescriptio longi
tempori3,’ either in the time of Cicero, or
when the true Asconius wrote. The old

editions have ‘petita non est' at the end
of the sentence ,- and Zumpt says that he
does not know whether the ‘ non ³ is
omitted in any good MS. But Iordan
says, “ petita est F M, et, ut Videtur, ng.
omnes. petita own est, al.” The word
‘ viginti ' may be expressed in most of the
MSS. by the abbreviation XX. In Lag.
29 it is ‘xx0,' but 'm Lag. 42, ‘vigesimo
expressis litteris ’ (Zumpt).

If ‘ ipso vicesimo anno ³ is the true read-
ing, we must read ‘petita est.’ But the
reading of Manutius, which 1 have adopted,
requires ‘petita non est :' ‘for twenty whole
years, though during that time so many
praetors, so many quaestors, so many ca-
lumniatores had been in the province, the
Hereditas was not claimed of them in the
name of Venus? Zumpt, Orelli, Klotz,
and Iordan have ‘ipso vicesimo anno . . .
petita est.'

cognoscit .·] ‘causam cognoscit ' in the
common texts3 but, as Zumpt observes,
‘causam' is often omitted when ⁶ cogno-
scere’ is used.——‘ ad HS,' the reading of
the MSS. except Lg. 42 p. m. M φ. Either
reading is Latin.

10. an temptatur 2] ‘is this a serious
defence, or is it merely by way of making
a show of saying somethiiig?' Comp. 111
this chapter, ‘in Verre defensionis temp-
tare rationem.' For the sake of euphony
it is certain that the Romans sometimes
used the form ‘ temptatur? But we must
not therefore lose sight of the genuine
form, which is ‘ tenta-re,' and contains the
root of ‘ tend-cre?

Verres judicabat :] This does not mean
