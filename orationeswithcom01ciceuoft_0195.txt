IV. EDICTA MAGISTRATUUM.

THE development of Roman Law is the most remarkable phaenomenon in
the history of civilization. It was the result of free institutions among a
people who had a nice sense ofjustice, and a singular tact sor adminis-
tration ; but the mode of its development is unlike any thing else that we
know. Various institutions contributed to produce that immense body
of law which has had so powerful an influence on the legal systems of all
European nations, and forms so large a part of the rules of law under
which we all live and exercise our aetivity. Among these institutions
was the office of the Roman Magistratus.

The office of a Roman Magistratus was limited to a fixed period, after
the expiration of which he was answerable for misconduct during his
administration. There were several Magistratus who exercised the same
office at the same time, and each of them could check any miscenduet of
those who were his colleagues. The administration was also distributed
among several classes of Magistratus, each of which had their several in-
dependent functions3 but, though not subordinate to one another, the
Magistratus of the higher class had the power of preventing abuse of
power by those of a lower class, or of rendering their acts null. All the
Roman institutions were cast in a religious mould, and every Magistratus
must discharge his dutics in conformity to the will of the gods; the mode
of ascertaining which was by the auspices (auspiciis). Thus it is im-
plicitly declared by the Roman system that every Magistratus exercises
his power as the minister of heaven: every man employed as a public
functionary is an agent of a superior power in the moral government of
the world. Magistratus only, consuls and others, could observe the
auspices, the observation of which was called Spectio (Cic. Phil. ii. 32) 3
but, according to the old practice, tho Magistratus must have an augur
with him, whose sunction was to declare the auspices to be valid (nun-
tiatio), or to deelare them invalid (obnuntiatio), the effect of which was
to prevent something being done. ‘⁴ Nothing of a public naturc‚’‘ says
Cicero (De Divin. i. 2), “either in peace or war, was done without aus-
pices.'’ Verres, who cared not for religion, did not rcgard thc auspices :
he rose from the bed of his mistress Chelidon, to assume his high office,
