638 SICILY A ROMAN PROVINOF..

tax (vectigal stipendiarium), as was the case in Spain and with most
of the Punic towns. Their paynient was a variable duty, a tenth
or other quota of produce. Three cities, Messana, Tauromenium, and
Netum, had a Foedus with Rome, the effect of which is described by
Cicero, when he is speaking of the Tauromenitani, in these words (Lib.
2. c. 66), “ qui maxime ab injuriis nostrorum magistratuum remoti con-
suerant esse praesidio foederis.'’ The ternis of these ‘foedera' were
not the same3 sor the Tauromenitani were excused from supplying a
ship of war for the defence of Sicily, and the Mamertini (Messenii) were
bound by their Foedus to supply one (Lib. 5. c. 195 Lib. 4. c. 9).
Verres is charged by Cicero with releasing the Mamertini from their
obligation to supply and equip a vessel, and with requiring a vessel
from the Tauromenitani. The ‘ decumae ² of these foederate towns were
not let, or sold, as Cicero expresses it3 in other words, they paid no
taxes (vectigal) to the Romans. Five towns, Centuripa‚ Halesa,
Segesta, Halieyae, and Panhormus, were ‘liberae ac immunes ’ (Lib. 3.
c. (5). They paid no ‘ deeumae.’ In reply to the supposed argument of
the advocates of Verres, that the ‘aratores’ were his enemies on ac-
count of the ‘ decumae,’ Cicero says (Lib. 3. c. (39), ‘⁶ Well, those who
cultivate lands which are ‘immunes liberique,’ why should they be your
enemies? why should the Halesini, why the Centuripini, why the
Segestani, why the Halicyenses Ρ ” Α passage in Lib. 3. c. 40, appears
to create a difficulty: “ quid Halicyenses, quorum incolae decumas dant,
ipsi agros immunes habent ;'’ Cicero then mentions that the ⁴ decumae ’
of Halicyae were sold to Turpio at ‘ O. Med? The passage is explained
by ascertaining the meaning of ‘incolae,' which signifies persons domi-
ciliated at Halicyae, not ‘ cives ' of Halicyae. ‘ Quorum incolae ’ means
those persons, not citizens of Halicyae, who were domiciliated at Hali-
cyae, and cultivated lands in Halieyae ². These lands were only tax-free
when cultivated by ‘ cives.' One Diocles of Panhormus (Lib. 3. c. 40)
was the lessee of lands in the territory of Segesta, for no person except
a citizen could own land in this territory. Diocles was therefore obliged
to hire it3 and if he made Segesta his usual residence, he was an ‘incola ;’
and it appears that he paid ‘ decumae ’ sor the lands which he farmed in
the territory of Segesta. (See also Lib. 3. e. 23, note.) All the rest
of the eities of Sicily, except the three classes which have been men-
tioned, paid ‘decumae,' or tenths, in respect of their lands3 and all the
land that was liable to paynients to the Roman state was included under
the general name of, ‘agri vectigales.’ The ‘ decumae ’ were let pub-

they are not ‘ cives? See Lib. 4. (¹. 11, ‘ineolis vestris civibus Romanis.’
