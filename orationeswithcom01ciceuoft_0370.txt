Entellinorum] Entella was situated on
the east side of the river Hypsas, in the
interior, between Panhormus and Selinus.

Catinensimn,] The place is Catina. Ι
have followed Zumpt in writing Catina,
which appears to be the more usual Roman
form of the name, though the Greek form
is always Κατάνη. Catina was an ancient
Chalcidian colony on the south side of
Aetna and on the coast. It was founded
about Rc. 730, by the people of the neigh-
bouring city of Naxos. It is now Ca-
tania, a large city, which has often suffered
from its vicinity to the great volcanic
mountain.

Apolloniensem‚] Apollonia is probably
Pollina, a place near the north coast,
{bont eight miles east of Cephaloedium,

efalii.

Enyuinam,] The Greek name of the
place is ’Ἔγγυον 01 Ἐγγύϊον. The autho·
rity of the MSS. is 111 favour of represent-
ing the ‘y‘y by 99, which may have been the
Roman fashion sometimes. But it is con-
formable to the doctrine of the gramma-
rians to write ‘ Enguina? Engyum was an
old town of the Siceli, south of Halesa,
with a famous temple of the Magna. Mater.
The remains are said to be near Gangi
Vetere, south of the supposed site of Apol-
Ionia.

Capitinam]
Ptolcmy (iii. 4), supposed to be Capizzi, in
the highest part of the valley of the Symae-

This is the Capitium of

thus.
Inensz'bus,] Garatoni’s correction, I be-

lieve.—‘ Mensibus' Lg. 42, om. rell. ‘ Men-
sibus’ may be intended for ‘Inensibus.'
Ptolemy (iii. 4) enumerates Ina.- among
the inland towns of Sicily.

Elorinis‚] The Greek form 15”Ελωρον
01·“Ἐλωρος, whence we should expect the
Latin form ‘Helorus.' This town was
near the mouth of the river Helorus, in a
delightful country called ‘ Heloria Tempe ³
(ovid, Fast. iv. 477). A road ran from
Syracusae to Elorus.

Ietinis] Graevius, ‘Letinis’ codd.
But there are no Letini, and Graevius
supposed that the Ietini are meant whom
Pliny calls Ietenses. The Ethnic name is
Ἰετῖνοι, and the place is Ἰεταί (Thucyd.
vii. 2, so the name should be read, perhaps:
see Goeller; and Steph. Byz. ’Ῑεταί, who
makes the Ethnic name Ἰεταῖος).

Οείανίηοε,] ‘Citarinos' Zumpt. The
name is uncertain.—‘Acherinos:' ‘Ges-
therinos' Lg. 42. ‘Scherinos' has been
suggested.

redundarit] ‘ redundaret ' Lg. 42.
Halm prefers this reading.

44. Aetnensem] Hiero I. (Rc. 476)
transplanted the inhabitants of Catina to
Leontini, aud settled five thousand Syra-
cusans and as many Peloponuesians at
Catina (Diod. xi. 49). He also, gave to
Catina the name of Aetna. (Pind. Pyth.
i.) After Hiero's death the new settlers
