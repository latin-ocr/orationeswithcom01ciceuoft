EDICTA MAGISTRATUUM. 191

annually a kind of revision made of all that had been effected by the
Edicta. What was found good was retained in the new Edictum3 and
what was wanting was added ⁴. We may assume that law had become
a study, and received some kind of systematic development, before the
Perpetuum Edictum could have much effect3 for the lawyers must have
assisted in drawing it up, and putting it in its technical form. This .
mode of making law for all that concerned the ordinary affairs of life,
was well suited to a state which originated in a city with a small terri-
tory3 and it could be continued without inconvenience‚ for Rome was
still the centre of administration, and the rules of law which were esta-
blished at Rome were introduced by the governors into the provinces,
so far as they were applicable3 and though many countries and many
cities retained their particular laws under the Roman empire, the
tendency of their administration was to extend the rules of Roman law
to other countries3 not the rules of the strict J us Civile, for many of
these were only applicable to Roman citizens, but that more compre-
hensive law which grew up at Rome under the name of Jus Hono-
rarium.

The length of these remarks must be explained by this, that it
seemed necessary to show what the Edictum was3 which cannot be done
in few words. What is said here will be nseful to those who read these
orations, and generally to those who read other parts of Cicero. This
is that· peculiar part of Roman law· which the Roman jurists chiefly
laboured on: but to explain how they did this is entirely beyond the
present purpose. I have made no comparisons between the growth of
the Roman and of the English law, as is sometimes done, and done
very inaccurately. A student who wishes to see how the English law
has grown may read some of the chapters of Mr. Spence's “Equitable
Jurisdiction of the Court of Chaneery,'’ V01.i.‚ and particularly chap.
ix„ “ Actions on the Case.''

These remarks are founded on Puchta’s Cursus der Institutioneu,
Vol. i. pp. 313—362, and Ι have adopted, with very slight modifica-
tions‚ all that he has said on the Edicta Magistratuum. Ι have also
used Savigny, System des Heutigen Remischen Rechts, Vol. i.

⁴ This implies that the drawing up of an Edietuln by a Magistratus, before he entered
on his office, was a work ofsmne time and lnhour; and he must have had the assistam-e
of persons learned in the lnw. And so it was. Cicero says of himself and his Edictum
in his governnient ‹›1' Cilieia : “ Romae emnposni edietum : nihil addidi nisi quod publi-
cani nie rogarunt, quum Sannum nd ine venissent, ut de tuo edicto totidem verbis truns-
ferrem in menni. Diligentissiine seriptum eaput est quod pertinet nd minuendos sump-
tus civitatum ’¹ (Ad Div. iii. 8).
