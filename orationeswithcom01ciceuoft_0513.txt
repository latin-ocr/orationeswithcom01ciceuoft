ACT. II. LIBER QUARTUS. 495

foro, §QG sanctum apud illos et religiosum. Ibi est ex aere simu-
lacrum ipsius Herculis, quo non facile dixerim quidquam me vidisse
pulchrius, tametsi non tam mult-um in istis rebus intelligo quam
multa vidi, usque eo, judices, ut rictum ejus ac mentum paulo sit
attritius, quod in precibus et gratulationibus non soPum id venerari
verum etiam osculari solent. Ad hoc templum, quum esset iste
Agrigenti, duce Timarchide repente nocte intempesta ‘servorum
armatorum fit concursus atque impetus. Clamor a vigilibus fanique
custodibus tollitur, qui primo quum obsistere ac defendere eona-
rentur, male mulcati clavis ac fustibus repelluntur. Postea con-5
vulsis repagulis effractisque valvis demoliri signum ac vectibus
labefactare conantur. Interea ex clamore fama tota urbe percre-
buit expugnari deos patrios non hostium adventu necopinato neque
repentino praedonum impetu, sed ex domo atque ex cohorte prae-
toria manum fugitivorum instructam armatamque venisse. Nemo
Agrigenti neque aetate tam affecta neque viribus tam infirmis

also in a reelining posture‚ as the hero

monuments of Agrigentum, which some
who rests from his labours, and is received

remains are supposed to represent.

‘Rietum’ is the neuter. It means the
mouth or lips, as this passage of Lucretius
shows, v. 1063 :—

“ Mgllia ricta fremunt duros nudantia
entes :'

and another passage in Lib. vi. 1193. ·

Though ‘rictum' does not occur else-
where in Cicero, we have the authority of
Nonius Marcellus in support of ‘rictum,’
who says, ‘rictum neutrius generis ;' and
refers to ‘Max-c. Tull. De Signis) R3 E C
also have ‘ rictum.’ The touching of the
chin was one of the forins of supplication
among the Greeks, Hotniann quotes the
Iliad, i. 501, and refers to Pliny (H. N. xi.
45), “ Antiquis Graeciae in supplicando
mentum attingere mos erat.’' Hotniann
also cites a passage to the sanie ess'ect from
Arnobius‚ Contra Gent. Lib. 6. There
are other passages which show that to
touch the chin was the act os a suppliant ;
as Polyxena (Eurip. Ilecub. 347) says, ad-
dressing Ulysses :

 

καὶ πρόσωπον ἔμπαλιν
στρέφοντα μή σου προσθΐγω γενειάδος.

The statue could not be of colossal size,
if the devotees could kiss the mouth and
chin, unless it were reelining, which is not
the usual attitude of the statues of Her-
cules. But the god was represented in
several for1ns; as the ideal of strength
and endumnce, in a standing posture; and

into heaven. See Muller's Handhuch ἃς.
-—‘usque eo,' ἃς. These words refer to
‘pulchrius ;' and the translation will be
‘so beautiful, Judices, that fhe lips and
chin are a little worn, because in their
prayers and thanksgivings they are wont
not only to worship, but even to kiss it.'
We may perhaps conclude from this, that
it was a statue of Hercules ‘ rejuvenescent)
after the close of his earthly labours.

noete intempesta] Phil. i. c. 3, and the
note.

mulcati] This is said to be the true
form of the word, when hlows and stripes
are spoken of, as in Livy xxiv. 9, “ Legatis
prius indignum in moduni nluleatis.'' ln
this passage the old editions have ‘mule-
tati’ (Zumpt). See Forcellini. v. Mulco.
Whether there are two words ‘ nlulcare' and
‘muletare,' or ‘ multare: or there is onlv
one, of which the orthography was unsettled,
seems to bc disputed. A coinparison of
the usages of these words appears to lead
to the conclusion that there is one verb,
of which the root is ‘ mule) ‘ Morte . . .
multatos ' occurs Lib. 1. c. 5.

repayule's] This passage is cited by
Festus, v. Repagula, which word is thus
explained: “quae patefiwiundi gratia ita
figuntur, ut cx contrario quae oppangun-
tur ;’' so the passage is read in the Delphin
edition, but apparently it is corrupt.
