6. meorum autem] This passage shows
the sense of ‘ aute1n,' which is not that of
direct opposition, but of addition: it ex-
presses something further or more, and it

never stands first in a. sentence. See Cic.
De Am. c. 8, ‘Quis 051 qui‚' &c., fol-

absence of all assumption? in not claiming
the public hospitality, to which he was en-
1111οᾶ 05 a senator ; and 11115, though 110

learn that Cicero was now a senator, which
is evidence, if any were wanted, that he

lowed by ‘ Quis autem est qui?

quo in numero] Hc allndes to the
question that was settled by the Divinatio,
when the ‘consilium' or ‘judices,² deter-
mined that Cicero should be the accuser.
Some of the present ‘ consilium ³ were the
same persons, and some were not. The
‘ consilium ' which was formed for the
decision on the Divinatio may have been
the same which was formed for the trial,
but if so, it was changed to some extent by
the ‘rejectio’ or challenges. Zumpt has
‘ quo e numer& the reading of G12 5 λ.

inirniez'z‘iasjusz‘as] Asconius asks if ‘jus-
tas ' means ‘ magna& and he refers to the
1150 01 ‘injusto' in Virgil, Georg. iii. 347.
The answer is that it does not mean ‘mag-
nas ;' it means ‘well founded, sufficient.'
‘ J ustas ’ might be taken ironically here ;
or, if not, Cicero does not scruple now to
say that Verres had wronged his ‘qnae-
stor,' though he denied it in the Divinatio 3
and thus he adds one more to the long list
of the offences of Verres.

‘quaestoxu² But how is ‘religio' to be
understood? for the word must have a.
distinct meaning, and we must interpret it
by reference to the general sense of the
word, which implies a reference to divine
powers, or to the gods. The duty which
Cicero had midertaken was one that he
was bound to discharge faithfiilly‚ both in
the judgment of men, andin the judgment
of the gods, to whom he was responsible.
His sense of duty towards the gods pre-
vented him from burdening an oppressed
and pillaged people with any expense.
He alleges it as a proof 01· 1115 modesty
and his religious (in the meaning already
explained) sense of his duty, that he put
neither connnunities, nor individual Si-
cilians, to any cost on his account. A
senator, when he travelled not on public
business, might still have a kind of nomina-l
commission, called a ‘legatio libera,’ by
virtue of which he was received at the

public eost of the province, or 01· the towns,

whlizh he visited. Comp. Act. ii. Lib. 4.
