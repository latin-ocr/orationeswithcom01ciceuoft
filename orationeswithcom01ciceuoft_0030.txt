12 ΙΝ Q. OAEOILIUM

Defendo enim multos mortales, multas civitates, provinciam Siei-
liam totam. Quamobrem quia mihi unus est accusandus, prope-
modum manere in instituto meo videor, et non omnino a defen—
dendis hominibus sublevandisque discedere. Quod si hanc causam
tam idoneam, tam illustrem, tam gravem non haberem3 si aut 1100
a me Siculi non petissent, aut mihi cum Siculis causa tantae neces-
situdinis non intercederet, et hoc quod facio me rei publicae eausa
facere profiterer, ut homo singulari cupiditate, audacia, scelere
praeditus, cujus* furta atque flagitia non in Sicilia solum sed in
Achaia, Asia, Cilicia, Pamphylia, Romae denique ante oeulos
omnium maxima turpissimaque nossemus, me agente in judicium
vocaretur3 quis tandem esset qui meum factum aut consilium
posset reprehendere?

III. Quid est, pro deum hominumque fidem, in quo ego rei
publicae plus hoe tempore prodesse possim? Quid est quod aut
populo Romano gratius esse debeat, aut sociis exterisque nationibus
optatius esse possit, aut saluti fortunisque omnium magis accommo-
datum sit Ρ Populatae, vexatae, funditus eversae provinciae: socii
stipendiariique populi Romani afflicti, miseri, jam non salutis spem

sublevandis] A like use of ‘sublevare,³
‘to raise up,’ occurs in 0. 3 and 4. In
conformity with the generalizing sense of
Roman expressions, the word means either
to ‘ raise up for the purpose of supporting,³
01· ‘to raise up for the purpose of taking
away, or removing,³ as in Cicero De Am. c.
24. 800 note in Seyffert's edition, who
compares the double use of ‘sublevare'
with that of the German verb ‘beben'

3. pro deum Iaominmnqztefidem] What
did the Romans understand by this ex-
pression, which we find so difficult to
translate? We must accept the Roman
notion of ‘fides,³ which Cicero (De Off. 1.
’7) defines to be the ‘foundation of justice,³
that is, of just conduct or of the discharge
of duty (Or. Part. 22), for so he explains
‘justitia,' considered with reference to the
conduct of individuals. Further, in the
same passage of the De Officiis, he defines
‘fides' to be ‘dictorum conventorumque
constantia et veritas: or stedfastness and
truth in all that we say and all that we
promise. It is opposed to ‘fraus,³ 0110 of
the forms of ⁶ injustitia? The sense of the
passage then is this: ‘ What is there, in the
name of all that 15 truthful 111 the sight of
gods and men,' 810. ‘ Fides et religio ³ often
go together. Act. ii. Lib. 1. c. 8, ‘fidem
vestram ac religionem? That the phrase
should be used on less solemn occasions,

with little 01· 110 regard to its meaning, is
not surprising. See Ter. Andr. i. 5, 113
Hauton. i. 1, 9. Juvenal xiii. 31.

socii stipendiariique] The term ‘socii'
is osten used in conjunction with ‘ Latini ³ or
‘ Nomen Latinum ³ (De Am. c. 3), to denote
the free inhabitants of Italy who were 111
some sense under the dominion of Rome.
The full enumeration of the inhabitants of
Italy who were within the Roman dominion
before the Social War, Β.0. 90, was ‘Cives
Romani, Latini, et Socii? The ‘ Cives
Romani' were the citizens of Rome, the
citizens of Roman 001011105, and the inha-
bitants of Mimicipia, without any respect
to their particular nationality. The Latini
were the citizens of the old towns of the
Latin nation, with the exception of those
which had become Municipiaj the nume-
rous Coloniae Latinae were also compre-
hendcd mider the term Latini. The Socii
were the rest of the inhabitants of Italy, all
of whom before the Social War became
subject to Rome, and belonged to various
nations. The term Socii would seem to
imply something of a ‘ibetlus,³ by which
they were connected with the Roman state.
The Provinciales were the free subjects of
Rome beyond the limits of Italy, and of
course the term comprehended the Sicilians
among others. Before the Social War
there were only two classes of people
