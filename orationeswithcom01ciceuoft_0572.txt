554 IN O. VERREM

dendam. Ex his ego rebus omnibus, judices, ita mihi omnes deos
propitios velim, etiamsi mihi jucundissimus est honos populi, tamen
nequaquam capio tantum voluptatis quantum et sollicitudinis et
laboris, ut haec ipsa aedilitas, non quia necesse fuerit, alicui candi-
dato data, sed quia sic oportuerit, recte collocata et judicio populi

in loco posita esse videatur.

XV. Tu, quum esses praetor renuntiatus quoquo modo—mitto
enim et praetereo quid tum sit actum-sed quum esses renuntiatus,
ut dixi, non ipsa praeconis voce excitatus es, qui te toties seniorum

is a use of ‘posteritas ⁵ in Lib. 3. c. 50 and
55, which seems to help a little to the un-
derstanding of ‘ posteritas ’ in this passage.
The alteration ‘prodendae' seems to me a
corruption of the text.

The two principal passages as to the
‘imagines ² are Polybius (vi. 53) and Pliny
(H. N. xxxv. 2). These ‘imagines' or
masks of wax (expressi cera vultus) were
made to represent the person both in fea-
tures and complexiom and they were placed
in wooden boxes or niches (armaria) on the
walls of the Atrium. The ‘tituli’ of the
deceased, the titles of honour which he had
gained in his life, were written near the
receptacle of the ‘imago ς’ and the ‘ima-
gines ' were so arranged and connected by
lines (lineae) as to show the degrees of con-
sanguinity of the several persons. This
arrangement of the figures by lines made
what the Romans called a ⁶ stemma.’ Pro-
bably the arrangement was something like
our fashion of drawing up a pedigree.
Pliny says “ stemmata vero lineis discurre-
bant ad imagines pictas.'' The allusions to
this practice are numerous in the Roman
writers (Juvenal, viii. 1). It appears from
a passage of Isidorus (Orig. ix. 6)—“ stem-
mata dicuntur ramusculi, quos advocati
faciunt in genere, cum gradus cognationis
pa1·tiuntur‚’'—that the lawyers adopted
this practice of drawing up degrees of con-
sanguinity, as we see in the table of con-
sanguinity in any of the ordinary editions
of the Institutes of J ustinian. These
‘imagines ' were not made until after
death. Of course a ‘ novus homo,' like
Cicero, could have no ‘imagines ς’ and he
could only transmit his own ‘imago ³ to his
descendants. The ‘imagines ' of a family
were taken out of their cases on funeral oc-
casions, and carried in the funeral proces-
sion (Tacit. Arm. iv. 9). The effigies of
ancestors with their ‘tituli ³ were placed
in the Atria, that their descendants
might not only see the records of their

virtues, but imitate them also (V al. Max.
v. 8. 3). Polybius considered this prac-
tice conducive to a spirit of emulation.
VVhether a modern portrait gallery in a
large house has this effect or not, 1 do not
know. Becker, Handbuch ii. 1, p. 220,
has collected the passages concerning the
‘ ima gines?

instead of ‘ita deos mihi,' and see the be-
ginning of this chapter.

And we do not require the addition of
‘ digno,’ which is in some old editions.

15. toties seniorum effe] A ‘praeco’
proclaimed the result of the votes3 pro-
bably there were many ‘praecones’ (Cic.
De Leg. Agr. ii. 2, ‘neque singulae voees
praeconum ³). Zumpt asks how often pro-
claimed ; and he answers, at least 97 times,
for all the ‘ centuriae' are 193, of which
97 make a majority.

On the voting see Becker, Handbuch ii.
3, p. 100, &c. ; and on the reform of the
Comitia Centuriata, ii. 3, p. 1, &c. Becker
(p. 9) considers the following points as
established. 1. The Centuriae of Servius’
constitution are represented as independent
of the division into Tribus, but the Centu-
riae of the reformed constitution stand in
a definite relation to the Tribus: every
Centuria is a part of a Tribus. 2. On the
other hand the classes of the census still
remained under the reformed constitution,
and the number of the classes was not
changed. The voting was by Centuriae
which were still distributed into Centuriae
Juniorum and Seniorum, and the Centu⁴
riae were called to vote according to their
Classes. 3. There still remained the Cen-
turiae of the Equites and perhaps also the
Centuria of the Fabri.—This being esta-
blished, says Becker, the inquiry is reduced
to two questions, First, what was the
number of the centuries in the new ar-
