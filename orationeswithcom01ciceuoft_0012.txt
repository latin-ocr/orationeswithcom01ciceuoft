vi PREFAOE.

between the English reprint and Zumpt's larger edition is con-
siderable3 and nearly all the variations of the larger edition aro
improvements. The English reprint is very correct in the typo-
graphy, and very bad in the punctuation, which fault, however,
may be perhaps mainly chargeable on the German original,
which I never saw.

The history of the text of the Verrine orations is given* in
Zumpt's Preface. Readers of Cicero are greatly indebted to
him for what he has done. Indeed, we who can now read these
orations with comparative ease, are apt to forget how much we
owe to a long series of scholars. Zumpt's edition is what is
commonly called a critical edition, the main object of which is
the establishment of the text. For this purpose Zumpt collated.
two of the Wolfenb'uttel MSS„ which he calls Guelff. 1, 2. But
he derived most advantage from the “Lagomarsinianae novem
codicum Florentinorum collationes.'' The fragments of the Ver-
rine orations, which were published by A. Mai, 1828, from a
Vatican Palimpsest‚ did not reach Germany early enough for
Zumpt to use them, except for the fifth and last of the Verrine
orations. Zumpt has given in an Appendix (Appendix varian-
tium lectionum et supplementa annotationis) the readings of the
Vatican MS. “This Appendix‚” he says, “contains ‘farrago
variantium lectionum e codicibus ‘MSS et editionibus petitarum,
quibus in annotatione usi non sumus, aut uti noluimus.’'' The
Vatican fragments contain parts of the following books z—Act. ii.
Lib. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The MS. to which these fragments belong
is of high antiquity and undoubted value. Zumpt considers the
Ood. Vat. as the parent of Par. B. and Lag. 29, which he fur-
ther considers to be the parents of the inferior MSS. There
are many gross blunders in the Cod. Vat„ which prove that it
must be, in parts, at least, a carelessly made copy from a good
original. All the other MSS. Zumpt considers as the progeny
of a “ Cod. antiquus deperdituS,” a respectable , ancestor who
lives only in his descendants. As to Guelf. 1, Madvig is of
opinion that Zumpt rates it too high.
