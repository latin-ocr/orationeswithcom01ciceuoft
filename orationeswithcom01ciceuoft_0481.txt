XVIII. Melitensis Diodorus est, qui apud vos antea testimonium
dixit. Is Lilybaei multos jam annos habitat, homo et domi nobilis
et apud eos quo se contulit propter virtutem splendidus et gra-
tiosus. De hoc Verri dicitur habere eum perbona toreumata3 in
his pocula quaedam, quae Thericlia nominantur Mentoris manu
summo artificio facta. Quod iste ubi audivit, sic cupiditate in-
flammatus est non solum inspiciendi verum etiam auferendi ut
Diodorum ad se vocaret ac posceret. Ille qui illa non invitus
haberet respondet Lilybaei se non habere, Melitae apud quendam
propinquum suum reliquisse. Tum iste continuo mittit homines
certos Melitam: scribit ad quosdam Melitenses ut ea vasa per-
quirant: rogat Diodorum ut ad illum propinquum suum det literas ;
nihil ei longius videbatur quam dum illud videret argentum. Dio-
dorus, homo frugi ac diligens, qui sua servare vellet, ad propinquum
suum scribit ut iis qui a Verre venissent responderet illud argenn

non jam cupiditatem] Klotz and Ior-
dan have ‘et furorem jam, non eupidi-
tatem‚' which seems a wrong position of
‘jam ;’ but it is the 0010111011 reading.
Zumpt observes, ‘non jam esse non am-
plius notum est? The readings are ‘jam
non' R, Lagg„ ‘ noh jam’ G 1 Ld λ, ‘ 11011
uim ³ G 2.

18. De 1100 . . . eum] A good example of
the use of these pronouns. He has just
used ‘ is' in the usual way to refer to Dio-
dorus. If 110 had said ‘ De eo Verri‚’ this
second reference might have appeared ra-
ther too remote. He must repeat the
word ‘ l)i‹›doro,’ or use 11 1110110011 which
more direetly points to the person; the
‘hocf But ‘eum' comes again, having
the same relation to the ‘hoe' that the
‘ is ' has to Diodorum

Thericlia] R C (1 1 2. The common
reading is ‘ Heraclea.’ This 'l‘hericles was
a muker of earthen vessels, and lived in
the time of Aristophanes, according to
Bentley (Dissertation on the Epistles of
Phalaris). The name Thericlia was given
to cups made in imitation of those of Tbe-
ricles ; in imitation 01” 1110 style, 01” course,
for they were made in other material,
wood, silver, 111111 glass. Weleker denies
the existence of an artist 'rhei-icles, und
maintains that these cups were so called
from the figures 01” 1101011110Ι (θήριιι), with
which they were adorned; bnt this expla-
nation will hardly 110 received (Art. The-
ricles, in Smith's Dictionary of Biography).

Mentor was a worker in silver, and the
most celebrated of au the Greek artists of
his class. His period is fixed to some
extent by Pliny's statement (H. N.‚ Lib.
33. e. 12, ed. Hard.)‚ that his works pe—
rished either in the conflagration 01” the
temple of Diana, or in that of the Roman
capitol. 1171111101οι- the fact may 110, Pliny
supposes that Mentor must. have produ · -11
his great works before the burning of ila
temple of Diana, Β.(“. 356: see also Pliny
(H. N.‚ Lib. 7. 0. 31)). 'rhough the great
works of Mentor may have been destroyed.
his name snrvived, and works passed 0111·-
rent as his 111 Martial's time (iii. »1-1) :—

“ Inserta phialae Mentoris 111111111 ducta
Lacerta vivit et timetur argentum ;'’

and Jnv. viii. 101- :—

rarae sine Mentore mensae.’'

 

qm· illa vnonv iaz-ilem] This is only 11 1110-
toricul way 01” saying what 110 says shortly
aster, ‘ qni sua servare vellet!

nihil ei lonyius] 'rhis means ‘he was
impatient to see? Comp. Phil. 5. c. l.
vol. iv.

ad propinquum . . scribit] Zumpi's
reading 111111 lordnn's. 'l'he 0011101οι1 101111-
ing is ‘propinquo sno s‹·1·ibit.' Both ex-
pressions ure Latin. Zumpt observes, that
when ‘ scribere ' is equivalent to sending 11
letter, it is used with 1110 accusative3 when
it signifies to inform by letter, it hus gene—
rally a dative. 'l‘here may be some truth
