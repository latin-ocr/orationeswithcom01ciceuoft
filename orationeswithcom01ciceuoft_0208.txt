190 EDICTA MAGISTRATUUM.

and they appear in other systems of law under another sorm; for it
must be observed that a great part of the peculiar law of all countries is
peculiar only in form, not in substance. The Romans in their inter-
course with Peregrini were led to recognize that which, in substance,
but not in form, agreed with Roman institutions. Thus they recog-
nized a marriage as valid by the J us Gentium, though it was not a
Roman marriage, and could not have the effects of a Roman marriage.
They recognized an ownership ‘in bonis,' as co-existing with the Roman ’
ownership ‘ex jure Quiritium) They recognized forms of contracts
which Peregrini used, and gave to them a legal effect. One of the
most striking instances of this recognition of general principles is in
the case of ownership ‘in bonis.’ A Roman might have sold a thing to
another, and delivered to him the possession of it3 but, if the forms of
the J us Civile had not been observed, the seller was still owner by the
J us Civile, and could recover the thing by action. But the Praetor
considered the purchaser as owner: he allowed him a defence (exceptio)
against the seller, and even an action for the recovery of the thing
against any person who was in possession of it. He treated him as
owner, because he was owner according to the universal principles of
law, and he gave the purchaser all the advantages of ownership so far as
1115 office could give them.

It is clear, from what has been said, that the J us Gentium became a
body of positive law among the Romans. But it must not be viewed as
identical with J us Honorarium3 for the Edicta of the Praetor Urbanus
contained many rules of strict Roman law. Nor must we view Jus
Civile and J 115 Gentium as opposed to one another, and J us Civile again
as subdivided into Jus Civile and Jus Honorarium. For the Provincialia
Edicta contained both much of the J us Gentium and much particular
law; and the Edictum of the Praetor Peregrinus also. The J us Hono-
rarium, or the Edicta of the Praetors, were the organ by which the
Roman Law received its more general principles3 and the chief part of
these general principles are founded on the Jus Gentium. The oppo-
sition of J us Civile and J us Honorarium is strictly an opposition of
sorm; but to this form we must add the material opposition, which con-
sisted in this, that the matter of the Edicta was derived from another
principle than the Jus Civile: it was derived from the ‘naturalis
aequitas,' the characteristic of the J us Gentium.

The nature of the Roman mode of establishing law by the office of
the Praetor is briefly this: every year new Magistratus were ap-
pointed, and it was their duty to ascertain what was defective in the
law, and to supply it by the Edictum. The Magistratus were not
lawyers, but they had the advice and assistance of men who were
learned in the law (jurisconsulti, jurisprudentes). Thus there was
