EDICTA MAGISTRATUUM. 183

ought to be allowed, or when the case was such that common opinion
could not fail to acquiesce in the rule which had its first distinct expres-
sion through the organ of the Praetor. This mode of proceeding, this
growth of law out of popular opinion, is neither uncertain nor capricious
in those matters which relate to the usual transactions of life. A people
will often be bad J udges of the logical consequences which flow from an
established rule of law3 but their sense of justice is clear enough to
show them when a new rule of law is wanted, and what it should be.
It is the business of one who is expert in Law to give to the rule such
a form that it shall be fitted to accomplish its purpose.

Though it is uncertain when the Lex Aebutia was enacted, which led
to so great a change, the procedure which originated in consequence of
this Lex is much older than Cicero's time, and probably existed a een-
tury at least before he was born.

The mode in which a Magistratus made known any new rule that he
established, was not by a declaration in a particular case; a mode of
proceeding which, however disguised under the form of a declaration of
existing law, is an arbitrary mode of proceeding, when it is not really
a declaration of law, either in the way of a true deduction from a
legal principle or a just interpretation of a Statute (lex), or the recog·
nition of a custom. When a new rule of law is declared in a particular
case, which rule has no foundation except in the decision of the court in
that case, it is a mode of legislation, the cost of which is borne by one or
other of the parties to the suit. It is a mode of legislation imperfect
and unjust‚ because it establishes a rule of law for the first time, and
applies it to facts which existed before the rule. Such a mode of
making rules of law by establishing what are called precedents has given
to the office of judge a character which is quite inconsistent with it.

This was not the mode among the Romans, who had a means of
giving publicity to general rules before they were applied. It was an
old practice for all the Magistratus to make their will known to the
people by official communicatffins, Edicta, which were iu writing, aud
put up in public. The Consuls published Edicta for calling together the
assemblies of the people, enrolling troops, and summoning the Senate.
The Censors did the same sor giving notice of a census and other mat-
ters which belonged to their office3 and other Magistratus in their
several offiees did the same. An Edictum might refer either to a single
case, as, for instance, an Edictum for the mustering of the army ; or it
might contain a general rule‚ according to which the Magistratus
declared that he would act in certain cases ⁶. Edicta of a general nature
